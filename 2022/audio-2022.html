          Building upon and expanding the basic functionalities brought by HTML5's <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> media elements and <code>MediaStream</code> object, the Audio Working Group
          has developed the <code>Web Audio API</code>
          and continues to define client-side script APIs
          which support the features required by rich interactive applications including the ability to process and synthesize audio streams directly in script, as well as giving access to musical instruments through a bridge with existing system-level
          MIDI APIs.
        </p>

        <p>
          The audio API provides methods to read audio samples, write audio data, create sounds, and perform client-side audio processing and synthesis with minimal latency. It also adds programmatic access to the
          <abbr title="Pulse Code Modulation">PCM</abbr> audio stream for low-level manipulation
          directly in script. This API can be used for interactive applications, games, 3D environments, musical applications, educational applications, and for the purposes of accessibility. It includes the ability to synchronize, visualize, or
          enhance sound information when used in conjunction with graphics APIs. Sound synthesis can be used to enhance user interfaces, or produce music. The addition of advanced audio capabilities to user agents presents new options to Web developers
          and designers, and has many accessibility opportunities and challenges that this working group will continue to keep in mind.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to an audio processing API, this group has received feedback from the audio and music community and industry, who wish to Web-enable their MIDI-capable devices. <abbr title="Musical Instrument Digital Interface">MIDI</abbr> is
          an electronic device interface, developed by the musical instrument industry, that includes communication protocols for two-way connection and control of a wide variety of devices, including digital musical instruments, digital audio workstations,
          lighting sytems, game controllers, and many other systems. The MIDI specification has wide adoption and interoperable deployment across devices and computer operating systems, and to extend this existing infrastructure, the Audio Working
          Group is also developing a specification to create a bridge between the browser and existing system-level MIDI APIs, to make musical instruments first-class citizens of the Web.
        </p>

        <p>
          This working group will take into account common work-flows for sound creators, including considerations for common audio formats. This group will also liaise with other groups for direct connection to audio inputs and outputs, such as microphones and
          speakers.

          <p>
            The Working Group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt id="web-audio" class="spec"><a href="https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/">Web Audio API</a></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>This specification defines a high-level JavaScript API for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications. The primary paradigm is of an audio routing graph, where a number of AudioNode objects are connected together to define the overall audio rendering. The actual processing will primarily take place in the underlying implementation (typically optimized Assembly / C / C++ code), but direct JavaScript processing and synthesis is also supported.</p>

            <dd>
              <p>This specification defines an API supporting the MIDI protocol, enabling web applications to enumerate and select MIDI input and output devices on the client system and send and receive MIDI messages. It is intended to enable non-music MIDI applications as well as music ones, by providing low-level access to the MIDI devices available on the users' systems.</p>

	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
	  <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification.</p>
	  <p>Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
	  <p>
		Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
		recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>
	  <p>To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.</p>
	</section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from one week, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
