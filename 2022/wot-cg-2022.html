      Goals
    </h2>
    <p>
      The goal of WoT Community Group is to accelerate the community activities around the recommendations and notes published by the WoT WG and IG. More concretely, the group aims to:
      <ul>
        <li>Increase awareness of the WoT specifications</li>
        <li>Collect use cases from the wider community</li>
        <li>Collect implementation experience and references to technologies from the wider community</li>
        <li>Facilitate the implementation of the specifications by providing guidelines and tutorials</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2 id="scope-of-work">
      Scope of Work
    </h2>
    <p>
      In order to achieve the above goals, the scope of the Web of Things Community Group includes the following activities:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Organizing events such as hackathons, plugfests, ideathons, etc.</li>
        <li>Supporting other communities to host W3C WoT related events, i.e. satellite events</li>
        <li>Supporting communication between WoT-related developers through platforms such as Gitter, Matrix, StackOverflow, etc.</li>
        <li>Increasing the social media presence of the W3C WoT</li>
        <li>Handling questions and discussions on the standards of the Web of Things Working and Interest Groups</li>
        <li>Coordinate activities with the Web of Things Working and Interest Groups</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
    In addition,
    the WoT CG will report the results of its activities back to the Web of Things Working and Interest Groups,
    the W3C membership, and the Web community.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Web of Things Community Group, together with the Web of Things Interest Group will decide in the future how to manage the 
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things Website</a> together.
      How this collaboration will work is defined in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-cg/blob/main/wot-ig-collaboration.md">a separate document</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="out-of-scope">
      Out of Scope
    </h3>
    <p>
      Publishing recommendations (standards specifications) is out of the scope of this community group (thus the CLA patent policy does not apply)
    </p>
    <h2 id="deliverables">
      Deliverables
    </h2>
    <h3 id="specifications">
      Specifications
    </h3>
    <p>
      No specifications will be produced under the current charter.
    </p>
    <h3 id="non-normative-reports">
      Non-Normative Reports
    </h3>
    <p>
      The group may produce other Community Group Reports within the scope of this charter 
      that are not specifications, for instance use cases, requirements, implementation experience reports, or white papers.
    </p>
    <h3 id="test-suites">
      Test Suites and Other Software
    </h3>
    <p>
      There are no plans to create a test suite.
    </p>
    <h3 id="other-deliverables" >
      Other Deliverables
    </h3>
     <p>
        The group may produce deliverables to promote or explain the W3C Web of Things standard. For example (but not limited
        to):
    <ul>
        <li>Multimedia content: Videos, Podcasts, Slides, etc.</li>
        <li>Code snippets and examples</li>
        <li>Thing descriptions or Thing Models</li>
        <li>Tutorials (written or in other forms)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="liaisons">
      Dependencies or Liaisons
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Web of Things Community Group will manage dependencies and liaisons separately in the documents listed below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-cg/blob/main/dependencies.md">Dependencies</a></li>
        <li> <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-cg/blob/main/liaisons.md">Liaisons</a></li> 
      </ul>
      <p>
      Any changes to these documents need to be either a Pull Request reviewed by the chairs or agreed upon in a public meeting.
    </p>
    <h2 id="process">
      Community and Business Group Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group operates under the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/">Community and Business
      Group Process</a>. Terms in this Charter that conflict with those of the
      Community and Business Group Process are void.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing
      commitments under the <a href=
      'http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/'>W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>. When people request to
      participate without representing their organization's legal interests,
      W3C will in general approve those requests for this group with the
      following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an organizational
      commitment under the CLA starting with the individual's first request to
      make a contribution to a group <a href="#deliverables">Deliverable</a>.
      The section on <a href="#contrib">Contribution Mechanics</a> describes
      how W3C expects to monitor these contribution requests.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">W3C Code of
      Ethics and Professional Conduct</a> applies to participation in
      this group.
    </p>

    <h2 id="worklimit">
      Work Limited to Charter Scope
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group will not publish on topics other than those
      listed under <a href="#deliverables">Deliverables</a> above. See
      below for <a href="#charter-change">how to modify the charter</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="contrib">
      Contribution Mechanics
    </h2>
    <p>
      Substantive Contributions to Deliverables can only be made by Community
      Group Participants who have agreed to the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/">W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deliverables created in the Community Group should use the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document">
      W3C Software and Document License</a> where possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Community Group participants agree to make all contributions in the
      GitHub repo the group is using for each particular deliverable. This may be
      in the form of a pull request (preferred), by raising an issue, or by
      adding a comment to an existing issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only commits against this repository's deliverables are considered contributions.
      Discussions that take place in chat platforms, social media or similar are not contributions and 
      are exempt from the rules that apply to the deliverables.
      However, <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a> still applies.
    </p>
    <p id="githublicense">
      All GitHub repositories attached to the Community Group must contain a
      copy of the <a href=
      "https://github.com/w3c/licenses/blob/master/CG-CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING</a>
      and <a href=
      "https://github.com/w3c/licenses/blob/master/CG-LICENSE.md">LICENSE</a>
      files.
    </p>
    <h2 id="transparency">
      Transparency
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group will conduct all of its technical work, including organizational matters, in public. 
      All technical work will occur in its GitHub repositories (and not in mailing list discussions or in chat platforms)
      and any work or discussion that happens elsewhere is not considered official. 
      This is to ensure contributions can be tracked through a software tool.
      Announcements should be made via public emails and messages in chosen chat platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meetings may be restricted to Community Group participants, but a public
      summary or minutes must be posted to the group's public mailing list, or
      to a GitHub issue if the group uses GitHub.
    </p>
    <h2 id="decision">
      Decision Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      This group will seek to make decisions where there is consensus. Groups
      are free to decide how to make decisions (e.g. Participants who have
      earned Committer status for a history of useful contributions assess
      consensus, or the Chair assesses consensus, or where consensus isn't
      clear there is a Call for Consensus [CfC] to allow multi-day online
      feedback for a proposed course of action). It is expected that
      participants can earn Committer status through a history of valuable
      contributions as is common in open source projects. After discussion and
      due consideration of different opinions, a decision should be publicly
      recorded (where GitHub is used as the resolution of an Issue).
    </p>
    <p>
      If substantial disagreement remains (e.g. the group is divided) and the
      group needs to decide an Issue in order to continue to make progress, the
      Committers will choose an alternative that had substantial support (with
      a vote of Committers if necessary). Individuals who disagree with the
      choice are strongly encouraged to take ownership of their objection by
      taking ownership of an alternative fork. This is explicitly allowed (and
      preferred to blocking progress) with a goal of letting implementation
      experience inform which spec is ultimately chosen by the group to move
      ahead with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative and should be recorded
      in a GitHub Issue for groups that use GitHub and otherwise on the group's
      public mail list. Any group participant may object to a decision reached
      at an online or in-person meeting within 7 days of publication of the
      decision provided that they include clear technical reasons for their
      objection. The Chairs will facilitate discussion to try to resolve the
      objection according to the <a href="#decision">decision process</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process is
      fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favour
      or discriminate against any group participant or their employer.
    </p>
    <h2 id="chairs">
      Chair Selection
    </h2>
    <p>
      Participants in this group choose their Chair(s) and can replace their
      Chair(s) if 5 participants, no two from the same organisation, call for an election.
      To do so, the group must use the following process to replace any current Chair(s)
      with a new Chair, consulting the Community Development Lead on election
      operations (e.g., voting infrastructure and using <a href=
      "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2777">RFC 2777</a>). If there are not enough participants
      or the participants are from the same organisation, thus not meeting the above-mentioned
      criteria, participants should ask the Community Development Lead to intervene.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have 14 days to
      announce their candidacies via email, but this period ends as soon as all
      participants have announced their intentions. If there is only one
      candidate, that person becomes the Chair. If there are two or more
      candidates, there is a vote. Otherwise, nothing changes.
      </li>
      <li>Participants vote. Participants have 21 days to vote for a single
      candidate, but this period ends as soon as all participants have voted.
      The individual who receives the most votes, no two from the same
      organisation, is elected chair. In case of a tie, RFC2777 is used to
      break the tie. An elected Chair may appoint co-Chairs.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the
      Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development Lead,
      after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.
    </p>
    <h2 id="charter-change">
      Amendments to this Charter
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group can decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing the
      text using the <a href="#decision">Decision Process</a> described above.
      The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made by
      conducting a 30-day vote on the proposed new charter. The new charter, if
      approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself,
      or 7 days after the result of the election is announced, whichever is
      later. A new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast in the approval
      vote to pass. The group may make simple corrections to the charter such
      as deliverable dates by the simpler group decision process rather than
      this charter amendment process. The group will use the amendment process
      for any substantive changes to the goals, scope, deliverables, decision
      process or rules for amending the charter.
