      <!-- delete PROPOSED after AC review completed -->

      <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/distributed-tracing/">Distributed Tracing Working Group</a> is to
        define standards for interoperability between tracing tools. A tracing tool refers to a tool which is implemented as either a library or an agent to provide at least one of the following capabilities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Propagation of the context identifying a trace, i.e. an interaction with an application;</li>
          <li>Modification of trace information to indicate that additional trace information is available;</li>
          <li>Collection of tracing information for a specific trace.</li>
        </ul>

       <p>Interoperability for tracing therefore refers to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A standardized way to propagate vendor-specific tracing information across tiers instrumented with different tracing
            tools;</li>
          <li>A standardized and extensible format to share trace data &mdash; full traces or fragments of traces &mdash; across tools for
            further interpretation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
          <p>
          Modern cloud-native applications are highly distributed and often span multiple technology and vendor boundaries. The complexity
          of these applications requires a detailed understanding of how individual requests are executed. This is referred
          to as "tracing".
        </p>
      </div>
      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
          Tracing tools for collecting the individual requests information have been available for quite some time. However, these tools have not been
          built with interoperability in mind. This leaves the developer with a number of challenges in getting an end-to-end
          trace of complex transactions:
          <ul>
            <li>Traces are often broken, because trace context information is lost in a contributing tier or the trace is restarted</li>
            <li>Vendors cannot pass proprietary information across tiers instrumented with a different implementation and therefore
              lose relevant information (e.g. step count, server information, ...)</li>
            <li> End users don't have the ability to create complete end-to-end traces of application transactions which are monitored
              by different tools, as there is no defined data format and semantics for trace data</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The scope of this working group is the definition of data formats and headers enabling the propagation and correlation of
          tracing data across different implementations.

            Normative Specifications
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Working Group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt id='trace-context' class='spec'><a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/' rel='versionof'>Trace Context</a></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>This specification is the update of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context-1/">Trace Context 1</a> which
                defines headers and a value format to propagate context information that enables distributed tracing scenarios.
                The new revisions will include an improved semantic of the header to use for scenarios requiring the randomness of identifiers alongside their uniqueness.
                Future versions of the specification will also include mechanism to carry context information in protocol <em>responses</em>, including HTTP, thus
                context information to be accessed within Web applications and carried over between cloud services.
                The revision must define mechanisms that mitigate both <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/fingerprinting-guidance/">fingerprinting</a>
                and other <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/">privacy risks</a> exposed by
                Trace Context. If the mitigations include explicit or implicit user consent, as anticipated, the WG will define any
                necessary protocol elements for seeking that consent and formulate mechanisms for constraining the requests and resultant
                consent to the least-invasive possible form (e.g. listing specific domains or even hosts, as well as temporally limiting
                the permission consistent with the use case).

                This update is intended to include a mechanism to carry context information in protocol responses, thus allowing context information to be accessed in Web browsers.

	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
    <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent interoperable implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites, and two or more implementations interoperating with each other. In order to advance to Proposed Recommendation, each normative specification must have an open test suite of every feature defined in the specification.</p>
	  <p>Each specification should contain sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
	  <p>To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.</p>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

            <dd>The trace context standard relates to work around Server Timing done within the Web Performance group. Going forward
                it will make sense to define how trace context headers - specifically response headers - are related to the server timing header.
                The Working Group should coordinate with the Web Performance Working Group to ensure that the two specifications are
                aligned. Server timing headers may be used to carry the trace context information as well as the baggage data.

        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work
          on <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/distributed-tracing/tools">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
