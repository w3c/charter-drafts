        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
        The scope of the WebAssembly Working Group comprises addressing the need
        for native-performance code on the Web in applications ranging from 3D
        games to speech recognition to codecs—and in any other contexts in which
        a common mechanism for enabling high-performance code is relevant—by
        providing a standard portable, size- and load-time-efficient format that
        attempts to maximize performance and interoperate gracefully with
        JavaScript and the Web, while ensuring security.
        <p>
        Since the inception of the Web, various technologies have been
        developed to allow “native” applications on the Web.
        Techniques such as user consent with digital signatures and
        Virtual Machines with different capabilities than JavaScript
        failed to be robust in the face of increasingly high security
        requirements.

        Later efforts like
        <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/native-client">Native Client</a>,
        which featured robust security, failed to achieve cross-browser
        adoption.

        Cross-compilation to JavaScript using
        <a href="http://emscripten.org">Emscripten</a>,
        especially using the machine-optimization subset called
        <a href="http://asmjs.org/spec/latest/">asm.js</a>,
        achieved some degree of success. However, consistent cross-browser
        performance, shared memory threads, and other machine features have
        proved elusive.

        <p>
        The WebAssembly format addresses the shortcomings of those previous
        efforts.

        <div>
          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
          <p>In order to advance to <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#RecsPR"
          title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, the
          WebAssembly specification is expected to have <a

          least two independent implementations</a> of each feature it
          defines.</p>
          <p>The WebAssembly specification should contain a section detailing
          any known security or privacy implications for implementors, Web
          authors, and end users.</p>
          <p>The WebAssembly specification should contain a section describing
          known impacts on accessibility to users with disabilities, ways the
          specification features address them, and recommendations for
          minimizing accessibility problems in implementation.</p>

          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more
          active participants for its duration, including representatives from
          the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and
          Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors,
          and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a day per week
          towards the Working Group.
          There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public

          the meeting minutes from teleconferences and face-to-face meetings will
          be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue
          tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and

          of specifications will be developed in a public repository, and may

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due
          process, per the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#Consensus"> W3C
          Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other
          participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in
          discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and
          consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but
           consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of
           views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a
           decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
          resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face
          meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for
          example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period
          from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation
          of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the
          response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus
          as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless
          and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the
          discretion of the Chairs or the Director.  </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#Votes">W3C
