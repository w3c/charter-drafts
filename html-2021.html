      <section id="workmode">
        <h2>Work Mode</h2>
        <p>When WHATWG publishes a Review Draft of its HTML or DOM Living Standards, the HTML Working Group may request
          endorsement
          of this Review Draft as a CR, PR, and/or REC. The Working Group works to demonstrate to the Director that the
          contents of the
          WHATWG Review Draft have had wide review,
          issues have been addressed, and the contents have sufficient CR exit criteria as defined by W3C Process.
          The Working Group will look for a consensus of its participants to advance each Review Draft as a CR and will
          have worked to engage the community to make this consensus achievable.</p>
        <p>
          When there is an unresolved objection, the Working Group will make substantial effort to resolve the conflict so
          that W3C can
          publish a REC with no normative differences from the WHATWG Review Draft of an HTML or DOM specification.
          If the Working Group cannot reach consensus to bring a desired Review Draft forward on the REC track, it must
          ensure that
          appropriate issues are raised or encourage the WHATWG editors to re-open issues in the WHATWG repository.
        </p>
        <p>
          If unresolved differences remain, the Working Group will take the following escalation steps,
          each step to be reached only once the preceding
          steps have been given good faith efforts to reach consensus:
          <ol>
            <li>The Working Group shall attempt to resolve the objection, working to explain its members’ concerns
              to the WHATWG editors and other Workstream participants (through the WHATWG GitHub repository) and to
              explain the decision of the WHATWG to those raising the concerns;</li>
            <li>The Working Group shall escalate the disagreement to the WHATWG Steering Group to help resolve the issue;
            </li>
            <li>The Working Group shall explore techniques other than having a HTML or DOM specification with
              normative differences such as an extension specification; or as non-normative advice;</li>
            <li>The Working Group may request technical advice
              from the TAG. The TAG may consult other experts, including for expertise not currently available on the TAG.
              The TAG may be able to find some consensus or explain to one side or the other any negative impacts
              of their position;
            <li>The issue shall go to the W3C Director, who examines the arguments using the record of the tracked
              issue, the Working Group analysis, and the TAG analysis.
              <ol type='A'>
                <li>If the Director overrules the objections, then W3C continues its process to publish
                  the HTML or DOM Review Draft as a REC;</li>
                <li>If the Director sustains the objection, the Director and/or the TAG may choose to re-open
                  the appeal to the WHATWG Steering Group with any new data or rationale;</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>The HTML Working Group is expected to endorse a WHATWG HTML or DOM Review Draft to Candidate Recommendation
            at least once per 12 month period.</p>

      have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent
        implementations</a> are considered informative, not normative, for W3C purposes. </p>
    <p>Each specification is encouraged to contain or point to considerations detailing all known security and
      privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
    <p>
      Each specification is encouraged to contain or point to information describing
      accessibility implications for implementers, Web authors, and end
      users; and point to guidance on how specification features can be
      used to maximize accessibility in implementations.
    </p>	</section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="">HTML Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most HTML Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work in <a id="public-github"
            href="https://github.com/whatwg/">WHATWG GitHub repositories</a>. It may also use
          the public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-html@w3.org">public-html@w3.org</a> (<a

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          For the purpose of following its <a href='#workmode'>work mode</a>, this group will seek to make decisions
          through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C
            Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, a participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined
          in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting
          being required.</p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful
          consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along
          with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication
          decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey),
          with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group
          consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be
          considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available
          or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and
          includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
