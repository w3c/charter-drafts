          <p>
          Since the inception of the Web, various technologies have been
          developed to allow “native” applications on the Web.
          Techniques such as user consent with digital signatures and
          Virtual Machines with different capabilities than JavaScript
          failed to be robust in the face of increasingly high security
          requirements.

          Later efforts like
          <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/native-client">Native Client</a>,
          which featured robust security, failed to achieve cross-browser
          adoption.

          Cross-compilation to JavaScript using
          <a href="http://emscripten.org">Emscripten</a>,
          especially using the machine-optimization subset called
          <a href="http://asmjs.org/spec/latest/">asm.js</a>,
          achieved some degree of success. However, consistent cross-browser
          performance, shared memory threads, and other machine features have
          proved elusive.
        </p>
          <p>
          The WebAssembly format and execution environment address
          the shortcomings of those previous efforts.

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
          The scope of the WebAssembly Working Group comprises addressing the need
          for native-performance code on the Web in applications ranging from 3D
          games to speech recognition to codecs—and in any other contexts in which
          a common mechanism for enabling high-performance code is relevant—by
          providing a standardized portable, size-, and load-time-efficient format
          and execution environment that
          attempts to maximize performance and interoperate gracefully with
          JavaScript and the Web, while ensuring security and consistent behavior
          across a variety of implementations.
        </p>

        <p>
		Revisions to the WebAssembly Recommendation will be proposed periodically, capturing changes that have been incrementally adopted by the Working Group.
		Each successive version will incrementally incorporate improvements to support more machine level operations, increase performance, or to better inter-operate with embedding platforms, including features such as:
		<ul>
			<li>Multiple memories + tables</li>
			<li>Threads + shared memory</li>
			<li>improvements to SIMD</li>
			<li>Exception handling</li>
			<li>Garbage collected object support</li>
			<li>Component Model</li>
                        <li>64 bit memory addressing</li>
                        <li>Content Security Policy for WebAssembly modules</li>
                        <li>Tail call</li>
                        <li>ECMAScript Module integration</li>
                        <li>JS Promise integration</li>

	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
	  <p>Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
	  <p>
		Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
		recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>
	  <p>To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.</p>
	  <p>All new features should be supported by at least two intents to implement before being incorporated in the specification.</p>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the

        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work  on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>one week</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
