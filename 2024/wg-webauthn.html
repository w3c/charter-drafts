        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p>
          The Web Authentication Working Group develops specifications defining an API, as well as
          signature and attestation formats which provide an asymmetric and symmetric
          cryptography-based foundation for authentication of users to Web Applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall goals include obviating the use of shared secrets, i.e. passwords, as
          authentication credentials, facilitating multi-factor authentication support as well
          as hardware-based key storage while respecting the Same Origin Policy (SOP) by
          default and allowing for explicit, constrained SOP relaxation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
          The Working Group will determine use cases that the API needs to support and
          use these to derive requirements. Success will be determined by the implementation
          of API features as defined in this section of the charter.
        </p>
        <p>
          API Features in scope are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Requesting generation of multiple asymmetric key pairs within a specific scope (e.g., an origin) with crypto (signature and curve) agility and crypto parameter selection;
          <li>Proving that the browser has possession of a specific private key, where the proof can only be done within the scope of the key pair. In other words, authentication should obey the same origin policy;
          <li>Remote desktop (unattended operation) ability;
          <li>Ability to allow a non-modal UI;
          <li>Binding of ambient credentials;
          <li>Re-authentication from the discretion of the relying party;
          <li>Dynamic linking of authentication credentials;
          <li>Storing of private key(s);
          <li>Account recovery and/or credential backup options;
          <li>Facilitate relying party adoption through additional API enhancements such as returning transport indications in assertions, a credential &ldquo;durability&rdquo; signal, and credential status feedback signaling from relying parties.
        </ol>
        <p>
          Dependencies may exist on
          the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/credential-management-1/">Credential
          Management API</a> in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/">W3C
          Web Application Security Working Group</a> along with the <a
          href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-rd-20161004/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-rd-20161004.html">Client To Authenticator
          Protocol specification</a> in FIDO.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the details of any user experience (such as prompts) will not be
          normatively specified, although they may be informatively specified for certain
          function calls.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Web Authentication Working Group should aim to produce specifications that
          have wide deployment and should adopt, refine and when needed, extend, existing
          practices and community-driven draft specifications when possible. The APIs should
          work with a wide variety of authenticators and should not
          require non-standardized vendor-specific infrastructure. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Comprehensive test suites should be developed for the specification to ensure
          interoperability. User-centric privacy considerations of device management and
          credentials should be taken into account. The Working Group may produce protocol
          standards as needed by the API.

	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
    <!-- Testing and interop -->
	  <p>In order to advance to 
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have 
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent interoperable
			  implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where
interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites, and two or
more implementations interoperating with each other.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
    <p>
      To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications 
      in Candidate Recommendation 
      or to features that have deployed implementations
      should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.
      Testing efforts should be conducted via the <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt">Web Platform Tests</a> project.</p>
    <!-- Horizontal review -->

    <p>Each specification should contain sections detailing all known security and
      privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.
      The security considerations section must include a comprehensive
      threat model with threats, attacks, mitigations and residual risks.
    </p>

	  <p>
		Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
		recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>

    <!-- Design principles -->
    <p>This Working Group expects to follow the
    TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>.
    </p>
	</section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>The Working Group will establish
            liaisons with the other standards bodies working on particular authenticators as
            needed.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

          <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-webauthn@w3.org">public-webauthn@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webauthn/">archive</a>)
          and on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/webauthn">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>one week to 10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
