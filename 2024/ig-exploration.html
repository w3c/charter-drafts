        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p>
          This Group is intended to address several use cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>New ideas and dimensions: a new human step may impact
            the Web, e.g. "autonomous L4/L5 cars", "one continent
            forking the technology stack of the Internet and the Web",
            "sustainable blockchain", "6G Networks";</li>
          <li>New people: a welcoming point for people who are unfamiliar
            with our processes and systems, to understand the organization;</li>
          <li>New workshops: it's relevant and need to have align around the
            next steps for W3C, e.g. "generative AI", "Digital Identity on
            the Web";</li>
          <li>Monitoring industry trends: monitor other SDOs by leveraging the
            knowledge of W3C Members and enrolling them to monitor outside
            organizations, and report back on regular basis;</li>
          <li>Publishing Report: Create public analyses of trends that affect
            the web, seeking rough consensus or respectful presentation of
            competing perspectives on them. The analyses would summarize
            the trending topic, outline the promise and pitfalls that are
            being discussed, point to relevant W3C efforts, and indicate
            the degree of consensus in the CG on the value of the topic
            for the web;</li>
          <li>Chartering: there is a charter but need to measure the interest
            from W3C community at large and make it fit in the larger
            picture, e.g. Real Estate IG.</li>

          for the benefit of Web users, accelerate chartering investigations
          and endeavors, and continually strengthen the innovation of W3C.
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
          Work with W3C Members and the W3C Team to propose, prioritize, and
          assist in organizing Workshops or other events. Topics may come

          and Liaison Reports, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Work with W3C Members and W3C Team to prioritize potential
          work areas, to facilitate creation of Community Groups, to
          coordinate among Community Groups, and to advise on how to
          transition work from CG to WG;
        </li>
        <li>
          Work with W3C Members and the W3C Team to monitor W3C Liaisons,

          back on potential areas of investigations;
        </li>
        <li>
          Discuss how to continue improving the exploration and

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Interest Group is expected to have 6 or
          more active participants for its duration. The Chairs
          are expected to contribute a quarter of a working day per week
          towards the Interest Group. There is no minimum requirement for
          other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute through its public communication channels.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

          Communication
        </h2>
        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Interest Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="">Exploration Interest Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Exploration Interest Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work  <i class="todo">pick one, or both, as appropriate:</i> on the public mailing list <a class="todo" id="public-name" href="mailto:public-[email-list]@w3.org">public-<i class="todo">[email-list]</i>@w3.org</a> (<a class="todo" href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-[email-list]/">archive</a>)
          <i class="todo">or</i> on <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="[link to Github repo]">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

      <section id="decisions">
        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'><i class="todo">[pick a duration within:] one week to 10 working days</i></span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Interest Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
        </p>
      </section>



      <section id="patentpolicy">
        <h2>Patent Disclosures </h2>
        <p>The Interest Group provides an opportunity to
          share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
          Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
          disclosure obligations as set out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
            6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
          produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
          participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
          Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply. For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
          please see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/[shortname]/ipr">licensing information</a>.</p>
