        <p class="issue"><b>Note:</b> The <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a> requires “The level of confidentiality of the group's proceedings and deliverables”; however, it does not mandate where this appears. Since all W3C Working Groups should be chartered as public, this notice has been moved from the essentials table to the <a href="#public">communication section</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="background" class="background">
        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p>The W3C’s mission is to make the Web work based on the principles of accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security.</p>
        <p>The last two principles, Privacy and Security, are integral to <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights" alt="Article 3: Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.">human rights</a> and <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-civil-and-political-rights" title="Article 9: Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person">civil liberties</a> and have always been of the Consortium's concern.</p>
        <p>Also, in the Ethical Web Principles, there are several principles related to security both as a societal impact <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/#noharm">The web does not cause harm to society</a> and in terms of people's security <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/#privacy">The web is secure, and respects peoples' privacy</a>, where the goal is to create technology that creates as few threats as possible, or mitigates those threats</p>
        <p>Several working groups deal with security issues, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/webappsec/">develop mechanisms and best practices which improve the security of Web Applications</a>, develop <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/webauthn/">strong authentication functionality to Web Applications</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/securepay/">enhance the security and interoperability of various Web payments technologies</a>.</p>
        <p>Security is also a horizontal topic that often touches other groups and standards. Security can impact any protocol or API, which can have security implications. W3C Process mandates <a href="https://www.w3.org/2023/Process-20231103/#wide-review">Wide Reviews</a>, which is one of the Interest Group’s main scope.</p>
    </div>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>The Security Interest Group (SING) develops and documents guidelines, patterns, processes, and best practices for addressing security considerations in Web standards.</p>
        <p>SING provides "<a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/process/charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a>" -  offering groups developing web standards on-request guidance on security issues and mitigations specific to their technologies. SING aims to offer this review as early in the technology development lifecycle as requested, observing that early feedback is often more helpful. SING may also seek out technologies that benefit from earlier security reviews and conduct such reviews on its initiative.</p>
        <p>SING incubates standards work on security issues by collecting requirements, prototyping, and/or initiating the work within the IG and recommending that the W3C move the work into other groups when appropriate.</p>
        <p>SING may recommend mitigations for security issues in existing features of the Web platform, up to and including their deprecation.</p>
        <p>SING may provide input to the W3C Process Community Group on process changes that will improve security in Web standards, e.g., by establishing particular requirements for identifying and mitigating security issues in W3C Recommendations.</p>
        <p>SING may recommend to the W3C Advisory Committee and the W3C TAG regarding the security impact of proposed standards.</p>

            <p>The technical development of standards is not in the scope of the Interest Group. Identified Recommendation Track opportunities will be handed over to appropriate W3C groups if such a group exists or within a dedicated Community Group or Business Group when incubation is needed.</p>

        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the

Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href=""><i class="todo">Security</i> Interest Group home page.</a>

        <p>
          Most <i class="todo">Security</i> Interest Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.

          This group primarily conducts its technical work  <i class="todo">pick one, or both, as appropriate:</i> on the public mailing list <a class="todo" id="public-name" href="mailto:public-[email-list]@w3.org">public-<i class="todo">[email-list]</i>@w3.org</a> (<a class="todo" href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-[email-list]/">archive</a>)

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'><i class="todo">[pick a duration within:] one week to 10 working days</i></span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the <i class="todo">Interest</i> Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

        <h2>Patent Disclosures </h2>
        <p>The Interest Group provides an opportunity to
          share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
          Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
          disclosure obligations as set out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/patent-policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
            6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
          produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
          participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
          Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply. For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
