      <!-- delete PROPOSED after AC review completed -->

      <p class="mission">The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/pp/psig/">Patents and Standards Interest Group (PSIG)</a> is designed as a forum for W3C Members to discuss matters regarding the W3C Patent Policy as well as W3C copyright in particular and larger issues regarding patents, licenses and Web standards. The PSIG is an Interest Group that gives feedback to the W3C Team, the Advisory Board and the Advisory Committee; PSIG does not make final policy decisions on behalf of W3C.

      <p>
      PSIG is a forum for W3C Members and Invited Experts to discuss and provide feedback to the W3C Team, the Advisory Board and the Advisory Committee on IPR questions.
      </p>

      <p>
      PSIG may suggest further policy development and draft documents for such additional policies. Any policy development would be subject to Advisory Committee and Director review.

    <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
    <p>
      In May 2003, t he W3C Director, on the advice of the W3C Membership, approved the W3C Patent Policy as the governing document for patent matters in W3C Recommendations. The Patent Policy Working Group (PPWG), which developed that policy over a more than three year period, assisted the Team with the implementation of the policy, and the PPWG then closed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The W3C Patent Policy affirms and strengthens the basic patent licensing model that has driven innovation on the Web from its inception. The availability of an interoperable, unencumbered (i.e. royalty-free) Web infrastructure provides an expanding foundation for innovative applications, profitable commerce, and the free flow of information and ideas. The W3C Patent Policy encourages both commercial and non-commercial implementations of W3C Recommendations. Beyond establishing a commitment to royalty-free standards, the Patent Policy provides W3C with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a stable, practical, written policy for all W3C Recommendations</li>
      <li>a clear licensing framework for all W3C Recommendations</li>
      <li>consistent patent disclosure obligations, and</li>
      <li>an exception-handling process when problems arise.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    The Patents and Standards Interest Group (PSIG) was formed in December 2004 to provide an ongoing forum for discussion of general issues regarding implementation of the Patent Policy and to exchange views on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). Upon request, PSIG continues to provide feedback on whether changes to the Patent Policy are desirable and how those changes might look.
    </p>

    <p>
    Over time, PSIG has been asked for feedback on a variety of non-patent intellectual property questions. For example, PSIG opinions helped the W3C Team define the Community Group Licensing Agreement. In the discussion around HTML5 licensing, PSIG helped the Advisory Board evaluate licensing alternatives.
    </p>

    <p>
    In 2019-2020, PSIG helped to draft and review an update to the W3C Patent Policy to align with Process 2020. On the advice of the Membership, W3C adopted that policy on 15 September, 2020.
    </p>

    <p>This PSIG Charter continues the established practice for PSIG to
    discuss and provide feedback on IPR matters. This Charter also permits the PSIG
    to draft or suggest amended or additional patent policy documents.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="scope" class="scope">
    <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p class="todo">
        The discussion concerning the scope of the Patents &amp; Standards Interest Group was already started. The PSIG has not found a majority to treat legal subject matter beyond the patent policy and the W3C copyright licenses.
      </p>

      <p>
      The W3C Team, Advisory Board and Advisory Committee may request that the PSIG provide feedback regarding the W3C Patent Policy, issues related to patent commitments for participants in current and proposed W3C activities (for example, continuous development), and other IPR issues. The PSIG may also exchange views and flag issues regarding the W3C Patent Policy. It may produce non-binding Interest Group Notes on those specific issues.
      </p>

      <p>
      The PSIG will review, but is not responsible for formally documenting or implementing, W3C IPR policies.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="deliverables">
      <h2>
        Deliverables
      </h2>

      <p>
      As an Interest Group, the PSIG issues neither Recommendations nor other binding policy documents. It may draft policy documents or amendments to existing policy documents for Advisory Comittee review.
      </p>

      <p>
      The PSIG is responsible for maintaining the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/09/15-pp-faq.html">Patent Policy FAQ</a>. W3C participants can raise questions or comments on the W3C Patent Policy or Patent Policy FAQ via the <a href="mailto:www-patentpolicy-comment@w3.org">Patents and Standards Interest Group public comment mailing list</a>, or to W3C Team. The PSIG reviews proposed FAQ changes or new FAQ entries as follows:
      </p>

      <p>
      The initiative to add or modify a FAQ entry may start with either the Team or the PSIG. If it starts with the Team, the Team proposes the FAQ entry to the PSIG. If it starts with the PSIG, any PSIG participant may raise an issue to the attention of PSIG, Chair(s), and Team, with or without a proposed disposition. One PSIG Chair must reply within <strong>7 days</strong> with one of these two dispositions:
      </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        PSIG heads-up. If the entry is likely uncontroversial, the PSIG Chair(s) forwards the proposal to the PSIG list with a comment deadline of <strong>14 days</strong>. Unless someone on the PSIG objects within 14 days, then the proposal may be added to the FAQ by the Team on the 15th day. If there is an objection from the PSIG, then it will be added to the PSIG agenda for discussion.
      </li>
      <li>
        PSIG Agenda. If the proposal raises some substantial issue in the judgment of the PSIG Chair(s), then it will be sent to the PSIG list for comment and discussion will be scheduled for the next PSIG teleconference. After that, the PSIG will report back on the results.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The PSIG shall report at least annually to the Advisory Committee on its activities.
    </p>
    </section>

	<section id="success-criteria">
	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>

        <p class="todo">
          PSIG itself does not create new documents and thus has no document related success criteria. PSIG is there to solve issues arising from the interpretation of the W3C Patent Policy and from the W3C Copyright licenses.
        </p>
	
  </section>
  <section id="coordination">
    <h2>Coordination</h2>

      <p>
        The PSIG will coordinate with the W3C Advisory Board, the Advisory Committee and the W3C Team on IPR matters raised. During considerations and as needed, PSIG can informally liaise with the relevant institutions in the standards and public policy communities around the world. Informal coordination is done via the Interest Group's mailing lists.
      </p>

  <section class="participation">
    <h2 id="participation">
      Participation
    </h2>
      <p>
        Any W3C Member may nominate up to 3 participants to the PSIG. The Chair(s) may invite qualified Invited Experts to participate in the PSIG in accordance with the Invited Expert provisions in the Process Document.
      </p>

      <p>
        To the extent that PSIG participants are attorneys, they shall not be deemed to provide legal advice to W3C. Discussions, even about legal topics and while focused on a use case, are mere discussions and do not represent a legal opinion, express or implied.
      </p>
  <section class="communication">
    <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

      <p id="member">
        The Patents and Standards Interest Group is a Member-only forum. PSIG mailing lists and their archives are <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#confidentiality-levels">Member accessible</a>. The Interest Group functions primarily through an email discussion list hosted by W3C. The main PSIG list is &lt;member-psig@w3.org&gt; with a Member accessible <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/member-psig/">archive</a>. It is expected that face-to-face meetings will take place on the order of once or twice each year, or as necessary, at the discretion of the Chair(s).
      </p>

      <p>
       To contact the Group or raise an issue with the Group, a message can be sent to the Chairs or the Team contact of the PSIG. Members may write directly to the PSIG's <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/member-psig/">PSIG Member only mailing-list</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
      </section>

  <section id="decisions">
    <h2>
      Decision Policy
    </h2>
    <p>
      This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
    <p>
        However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
    </p>
    <p>
      All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
