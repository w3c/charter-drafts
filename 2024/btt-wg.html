        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>The scope of the Browser Testing and Tools Working Group includes protocols and APIs
          for the purpose of automating testing of Web applications running in browsers—for example,
          to simulate user actions such as clicking links, entering text, and submitting forms.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="deliverables">
        <h2>
          Deliverables
        </h2>

        <p><i>Draft state</i> indicates the state of the deliverable at the time of
          the charter approval. The Working Group intends to publish the latest
          state of their work as Candidate Recommendation and does not
          intend to advance their documents to Recommendation (no explicit
          milestones). The Group expects to continuously update the
          Candidate Recommendation once it reaches that stage.</p>

        <section id="normative">
          <h3>
            Normative Specifications
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Working Group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt id="webdriver" class="spec"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/">WebDriver</a></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>WebDriver is a remote control interface that enables introspection and control of user agents. It provides a platform- and language-neutral wire protocol as a way for out-of-process programs to remotely instruct the behavior of web browsers.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt id="webdriver-bidi" class="spec"><a href="https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi/">WebDriver Bidirectional Protocol</a></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>The WebDriver Bidirectional Protocol extends WebDriver by introducing a bidirectional communication mechanism; in place of the strict command/response format of WebDriver, that bidirectional communication mechanism permits events to stream from the user agent to the controlling software, better matching the evented nature of the browser DOM.</p>
            </dd>

            Other Deliverables
          </h3>
          <p>
            Other non-normative documents may be created such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use case and requirement documents;</li>
            <li>Test suite and implementation report for the specification;</li>

      </section>

	<section id="success-criteria">
	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>

    <!-- Testing and interop -->
          <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent interoperable implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites, and two or more implementations interoperating with each other. In order to advance to Proposed Recommendation, each normative specification must have an open test suite of every feature defined in the specification.</p>

          <p>To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications in Candidate Recommendation or to features that have deployed implementations will have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>. Testing efforts will be conducted via the <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt">Web Platform Tests</a> project.</p>

          <!-- Horizontal review -->

          <p>Each specification will contain sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

          <p>Each specification will contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>

          <!-- Design principles -->
          <p>This Working Group expects to follow the TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>.</p>
	</section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.  Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.
        The Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of each specification. The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>
        <p>Per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>, additional technical coordination will be conducted with the following groups:</p>

        <h2 id="participation">
          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues in its GitHub repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="communication">
        <h2>
          Communication
        </h2>
        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/browser-tools-testing/">group’s home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the group’s teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work in its <span id="public-github">GitHub repos</span>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/w3c/webdriver">WebDriver spec repo</a>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/w3c/webdriver-bidi">WebDriver BiDi spec repo</a>
        </ul>
        <p>The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.</p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="decisions">
        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to <span id='cfc'>10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group will be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
