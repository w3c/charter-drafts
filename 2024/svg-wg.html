        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p>
            Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) describes graphics in a way that is scalable to different device resolutions
            in a manner that is accessible, stylable, and scriptable.
          </p>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
            The SVG WG maintains the deliverables listed in this charter. They consist of the following technologies, all
            of which are in scope for the SVG Working Group:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A <dfn>syntax</dfn> for retained-model structured graphics. Both XML and HTML syntaxes are supported and
            CSS is used for styling.
            </li>
            <li>A <dfn>rendering model</dfn> which describes how SVG elements are rendered.
            </li>
            <li>An <dfn>object model</dfn> and set of APIs, to support scripting and user interaction.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <p>
            The SVG WG's focus in this charter period is on <em>maintenance</em> and <em>interoperability testing</em> of
            the core SVG specification, to ensure specification quality, test quality and completeness for the existing features.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Changes to the specification will be made as necessary, to improve integration with CSS and HTML for animations, styling, layout and semantics.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the Working Group will not introduce new features and will not incubate new proposals. 
            Other fora like the SVG CG or WICG are natural places for incubation, experimenting and testing new features.
        </p>

        <section id="section-out-of-scope">
          <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
          <p>
            The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this Working group.
          </p>
          <ul class="out-of-scope">
            <li>changes to the HTML parsing algorithm.
            </li>
          </ul>

            Updated document status is available on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/svg/publications">group
            publication status page</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Draft state</i> indicates the state of the deliverable at the time of the charter approval. The Working
            Group intends to publish the latest state of their work as Candidate Recommendation (with Snapshots). SVG2
            progress to further stages on the Recommendation track is dependent on increased participation level in the
            group.

            Normative Specifications
          </h3>
          <p>
            The SVG Working Group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt id="SVG2" class="spec">

              <p>
                This specification defines the features and syntax for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) Version 2. SVG is
                a language based on XML for describing two-dimensional vector and mixed vector/raster graphics. SVG
                content is stylable, scalable to different display resolutions, and can be viewed stand-alone, mixed
                with HTML content, or embedded using XML namespaces within other XML languages. SVG also supports
                dynamic changes; script can be used to create interactive documents, and animations can be performed
                using declarative animation features or by using script.

	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
      <p>Each module is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> 
        of each of the features it defines, and to provide evidence for this claim based on tests. The Working Group is therefore expected to proactively work on
         writing, reviewing, and maintaining tests. Doing so concurrently with its work on specification text is recommended; among other benefits, it helps minimize 
         accidental divergence between implementations and specifications, test results may also inform discussions on specifications, and failing test may stimulate 
         implementers to update their implementations accordingly. Testing efforts should be conducted via the <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt">Web 
         Platform Tests</a> project.</p>
      <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
      <p>
        Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
        recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>
      <p>
        Modules that reach <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#rec-publication" title="Recommendation">W3C Recommendation</a>, are considered successful
        when all of the following are present:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Production of stable documents addressing the work items listed in the Deliverables section.</li>
        <li>Test suites for each module with conformance criteria.</li>
        <li>Availability of multiple, independent, interoperable implementations of each feature with conformance criteria in each deliverable; as demonstrated by an implementation report (summarizing implementation status against the relevant test suite) for each testable class of product, including user agents.</li>
        <li>Deployment on multiple types of platform (traditional computers, phones, tablets, accessibility aids, print formatters, and so on).</li>
        <li>User community and industry adoption of the group deliverables.</li>
      </ul>
	  
    <p>Each specification should contain sections detailing all known security and
      privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

    <p>The SVG Working Group expects to follow the
    TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>.

        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, the SVG Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The SVG Working 
          Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The SVG Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

        <p>
            The Working Group is expected to have a Chair and participating contributors acting as maintainers for the
            specifications. The Chair is expected to guide contributors on how to make changes to the specifications,
            and, where appropriate, to make sure fixes to the specification have an accompanying web platform test.
          </p>
          <p>
            The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as
            described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their
            agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/patent-policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Participants in the group are required (by the <a href=
            "https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the W3C <a href=

            Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href=
            "https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from
            teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and
            issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public.
            Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit
            direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
          </p>
          <p>
            Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and
            meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/svg">SVG Working
            Group home page.</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Teleconferences are not expected, but can be conducted on an as-needed basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            This group primarily conducts its technical work on <a id="github-issues" href=
            "https://github.com/w3c/svgwg/issues">GitHub issues</a>. The public is invited to review, discuss and
            contribute to this work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of
            the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests
            such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
				<p>This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the 
				  <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. 
				  Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members 
					of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.
				</p>
          <p>
            However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful
            consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision
            along with any objections.
          </p>
          <p>
            To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication
            decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for
            consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based
            survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>one week to 10 working days</span>, depending on the
            chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised by the end of the
            response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
          </p>
          <p>
						All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available 
						or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
					</p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Votes">W3C Process 
            Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
