    <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid">Federated Identity Working Group</a> is to
      develop specifications to allow a website to request a federated identity
      credential or assertion with the purpose of authenticating a user and/or requesting a set of claims in a
      compatible way to OIDC or SAML.</p>

      <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
      <p>
        With changes to the support for underlying <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/privacy-principles/'>privacy principles</a>, 
        fundamental assumptions of the web platform are being redefined or removed. While overall good for the web, the
        <a href='https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/web-without-3p-cookies/'>third-party cookie deprecation</a>
        removes a building block used by certain designs of federated
        identity. This Group aims to bridge the gap for the federated identity designs which relied
        on third-party cookies.
      </p>
    </div>

    <section id="scope" class="scope">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>The Working Group will specify new web platform features intended to be implemented in browsers or similar user
        agents. The purpose of these features is to support authentication and authorization flows without compromising
        security principles for Identity Providers (IdPs), Relying Parties (RPs), and User Agents as well as protecting user
        privacy. Here "privacy" minimally refers to the appropriate processing of personal information. The result of
        this work is the development of new mechanisms that define how information is passed by the browser between the
        RP, the IdP, and authentication intermediaries to facilitate federated authentication; these mechanisms are not
        an authentication method.</p>

      <p>If any of the mechanisms developed to support authentication and authorization flows would cause
        breaking changes for existing protocols, work on that mechanism must include a well-documented transition
        period.</p>

      <section id="section-out-of-scope">
        <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
        <p>The identity space is much larger than federated authentication. While several topics related to
          identity may be of interest, they are out of scope for our work.</p>

        <p>Specific topics out of scope:</p>
        <ul class="out-of-scope">

          <li>New authentication methods</li>

          <li>Design and discussion regarding individual credential and assertion formats</li>

          <li>Ad-tech tools or APIs</li>

        <dl>
          <dt id="fedcm" class="spec"><a href="https://fedidcg.github.io/FedCM/">Federated Credential Management API</a>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>This specification defines an API that allows users to login to websites with their federated accounts in a
              privacy-preserving manner.</p>

          <dd>
            <p>This specification defines an API to inform the Web Application of their user's
              login status, so that other Web APIs can operate with this additional signal. Currently a separate
            chapter in the Fed CM specification, the goal is to publish it as a separate deliverable to be used by
            FedCM.</p>

      <h2>Success Criteria</h2>

      <!-- Testing and interop -->
      <p>In order to advance
        to
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed
          Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent
          interoperable
          implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where
        interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites, and two or
        more implementations interoperating with each other. In order to advance to
        Proposed Recommendation, each normative specification must have an open
        test suite of every feature defined in the specification.
      </p>
      <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
      <p>
        To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications
        in Candidate Recommendation
        or to features that have deployed implementations
        should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.
        Testing efforts should be conducted via the <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt">Web Platform
          Tests</a> project.</p>

      <!-- Horizontal review -->

      <p>Each specification should contain sections detailing all known security and
        privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

      <p>Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including
        ways specification features can be used to address them, and
        recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>

      <!-- Design principles -->
      <p>This Working Group expects to follow the
        TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section id="coordination">
      <h2>Coordination</h2>

      <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
        accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
        Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/"
          title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
        Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>. The
        Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups
        throughout development of
        each specification. The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before
        first entering
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is
        encouraged
        to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a
        review.
      </p>

      <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a

        Participation
      </h2>
      <p>
        To be successful, this Working Group  should have participation from large-scale Identity
        Provider (IdP) operators, large-scale Relying Parties (RPs), federation operators, and
        browser vendors. In addition, there must be active Editors and Test Leads for each
        specification. 
        
        The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute
        half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement
        for other Participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as
        described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement
        to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
        W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

        Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from
        teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue
        tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working
        Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct
        public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
      </p>
      <p>
        Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and
        meetings) will be available from the <a href="">Federated Identity Working Group home page.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Most Federated Identity Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and
        will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        This group primarily conducts its technical work on <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid/tools">GitHub issues</a>.
        The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the
        Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a
        discussion.

      <h2>
        Decision Policy
      </h2>
      <p>
        This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>.
        Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with
        members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
      <p>
        However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful
        consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along
        with any objections.
      </p>
      <p>
        To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication
        decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

        A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based
        survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>one week to 10
            working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

        If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have
