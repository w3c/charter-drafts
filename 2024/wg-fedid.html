      <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
      <p>
        Identity on the Web is critical to online interaction, with many privacy and security implications. 
      <p>
      <p>
        The W3C fosters an ecosystem that addresses privacy, security, and user sovereignty.
      </p>
      <p>
        This includes developing new mechanisms that allow individuals to select identity information relevant to a given interaction, such as assertions, specific credentials, or specific attributes, supporting an open wallet ecosystem.
      <p>
      <p>
        These mechanisms must also be viable for issuers, identity providers, verifiers, and relying parties to exchange information securely and privacy-preserving.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user agent is the coordinator of these transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, while protocols and formats are being developed elsewhere (e.g., ISO, IETF, OIDF, and other W3C Groups), the Web platform layer must also be standardized to provide a secure and privacy-preserving API framework that is protocol-and-format-agnostic and compatible with identity request/response protocols and different formats.
      </p>
    </div>

    <section id="scope" class="scope">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>
        The Federated Identity Working Group defines Web Platform features that allow user agents to support secure and privacy-preserving interactions related to digital identities. 
      </p>  
      <p>
        These features are intended to support different interaction flows (e.g., authentication, authorization, requesting identities or credentials, and issuance) in a 'traditional' federated identity model - with Identity Providers (IdPs) or Relying Parties (RPs) - and in a digital wallet 'decentralized' model - with Issuers, Holders, and Verifiers.
      <p>
        If any mechanisms developed to support authentication and authorization flows would cause breaking changes for existing protocols, work on that mechanism must include a well-documented transition period.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, 'privacy' minimally refers to the appropriate processing of personal information and preventing third parties from learning anything about the end-user's environment (e.g., which wallets are available, their brand, and their capabilities). 
      </p>
      <p>
        This group develops new mechanisms that define how information is passed by the user agent between the different entities to facilitate federated and digital identities:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enabling a Federated Identity Model while adhering to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/privacy-principles/" rel="nofollow">privacy principles</a> despite the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/web-without-3p-cookies/" rel="nofollow">deprecation of third-party cookies</a>, a cornerstone of such operations.<li>
        <li>Enabling a Decentralized Identity Model by invoking a wallet without <a href="https://github.com/WICG/digital-identities/blob/main/custom-schemes.md" rel="nofollow">custom schemes</a>, since they have <a href="https://github.com/WICG/digital-identities/blob/main/custom-schemes.md#can-wallets-reliably-determine-their-invoker" rel="nofollow">security</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WICG/digital-identities/blob/main/custom-schemes.md#what-are-the-privacy-implications-of-a-wallet-accepting-custom-schemes" rel="nofollow">privacy</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/WICG/digital-identities/blob/main/custom-schemes.md#user-experience-concerns" rel="nofollow">user experience implications</a> and cannot work reliably or securely in cross-device scenarios.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These mechanisms are not authentication methods, but if any mechanisms developed would cause breaking changes for existing protocols, work on that mechanism must include a well-documented transition period.
      </p>

        <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
        <p>
          The identity space is much larger than that of federated authentication and digital credential wallets. While several topics related to identity may be of interest, they are out of the scope for our work.
        </p>

        <p>Specific topics out of scope:</p>
        <ul class="out-of-scope">
          <li>Designing new authentication methods.</li>
          <li>Designing individual credential and assertion formats</li>
          <li>Performing any security or confidence assessment (e.g., checking signatures,
            audience, encoding, etc) of the <a
            href="https://fedidcg.github.io/FedCM/#dom-identityprovidertoken-token">token</a> that
            encodes the <a href="https://fedidcg.github.io/FedCM/#fetch-identity-assertion">identity
            assertions</a>.</li>
          <li>Ad-tech tools or APIs specifically focused on advertising as opposed to authentication.</li>

      <h2>Success Criteria</h2>

      <!-- Testing and interop -->
      <p>In order to advance
        to
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed
          Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent
          interoperable
          implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where
        interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites, and two or
        more implementations (distinct browser engines) interoperating with each other. In order to advance to
        Proposed Recommendation, each normative specification must have an open
        test suite of every feature defined in the specification.
      </p>
      <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
      <p>
        To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications
        in Candidate Recommendation
        or to features that have deployed implementations
        should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.
        Testing efforts should be conducted via the <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt">Web Platform
          Tests</a> project.</p>

      <!-- Horizontal review -->

      <p>Each specification should contain a Security Considerations section that must include a Threat Model with threats, attacks, mitigations, and residual risks and a Privacy Consideration section as specified in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/">Self-Review Questionnaire: Security and Privacy</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3552">RFC 3552</a>, detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

      <p>Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including
        ways specification features can be used to address them and
        recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>

      <!-- Principles -->
      <p>
        This Working Group expects to follow the TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/">Ethical Web Principles</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/privacy-principles/">Privacy Principles</a>.

      <h2>Coordination</h2>

      <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
        accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
        Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/"
          title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
        Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>. The
        Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups
        throughout development of
        each specification. The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before
        first entering
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is
        encouraged
        to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a
        review.
      </p>

      <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a

        Participation
      </h2>
      <p>
        To be successful, this Working Group  should have participation from large-scale Identity
        Provider (IdP) operators, large-scale Relying Parties (RPs), federation operators, and
        browser vendors. In addition, there must be active Editors and Test Leads for each
        specification. 
        
        The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute
        half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement
        for other Participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as
        described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement
        to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
        W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

      <p id="public">
        Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from
        teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue
        tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working
        Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct
        public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
      </p>
      <p>
        Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and
        meetings) will be available from the <a href="">Federated Identity Working Group home page.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Most Federated Identity Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and
        will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        This group primarily conducts its technical work on <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid/tools">GitHub issues</a>.
        The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the
        Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a
        discussion.

    <section id="decisions">
      <h2>
        Decision Policy
      </h2>
      <p>
        This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>.
        Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with
        members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
      <p>
        However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful
        consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along
        with any objections.
      </p>
      <p>
        To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication
        decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

        A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based
        survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>one week to 10
            working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

        If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have
        consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
      </p>
      <p>
        All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available
        or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C
          Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the
        Process Document requires.
