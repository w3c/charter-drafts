        <h2>Scope</h2>

	<section id="background">
	  <h3>Background and Motivation</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML </a>
is a markup language for encoding and communicating mathematics.The need for 
mathematical rendering on the web was evident from the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/HTMLPlus/htmlplus_45.html">earliest days of the Web at CERN</a>,
and MathML was among the first specifications taken up and developed by the W3C in the mid to late 1990&#39;s XML/XHTML era. It received much attention and has created a vibrant ecosystem of implementations and integration outside of web browsers. It advanced on the Web itself becoming integrated, along with SVG, into the HTML Parser and the HTML Specification in the mid 2000&#39;s. Since then, much has happened. While MathML 
has much success with making math accessible
and has had wide adoption in the tools used to generate and consume math, browser adoption is not universal. The MathML 3 specification does not match some current Web realities; 
it does not contain precise enough requirements for interoperability with the now changed Web Platform; indeed, some features are either incompatible with, or subsumed by, new features added to the Web Platform outside MathML.
</p>
</section>

      <section id="scope-inscope" class="scope">
        <h3>Scope</h3>

<p>
The MathML Refresh Community Group (CG) was formed to begin revision of MathML to address perceived difficulties in the MathML 3 spec. The Math Working Group will advance, refine, and clarify the work begun by the MathML Refresh Community Group and ensure MathML&rsquo;s relevance continues to evolve, grow and improve. In particular, there are three 
goals the Math WG will work toward:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Wide adoption by browsers of a core set of presentational elements so that authors can be assured that mathematics will be displayed similarly in all browsers, without having to rely on external libraries to do the display.
</li>
<li>
Increased accessibility of Presentation MathML for both
mathematics and chemical formulas achieved by allowing a means 
of specifying relevant mathematical intent, as well as by 
providing guidelines for interpreting Presentation MathML in the 
absence of additional information.
</li>
<li>
Ensuring that mathematical formulations are better searchable.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Working Group will begin by providing a thorough review and refinement of MathML Core Level 1, a restricted form of MathML created by the MathML Refresh Community Group, which has done the initial hard work of largely aligning with features of the current Web platform and precisely defining MathML&#39;s rendering, including integration with current CSS and basic DOM, and providing tests and opening bugs.
</p>
<p>
The Working Group will take up new work, such as problems the CG identified as requiring better solutions in order to move MathML in the Web Platform forward, in proposing a MathML Core Level 2.
</p>
<p>
The Working Group will also overhaul MathML 3 by building upon these fundamentals and experience with needs for accessibility, and on many years of practical experience and use (or lack thereof), to create a path forward to a MathML 4.
</p>
<p>
The scope of the Math Working Group includes the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Development of Recommendations as outlined above.
</li>
<li>
Development of a test suite to check conformance of implementations.
</li>
<li>
Clarifications to the current use of Web Platform technologies, such as supported JavaScript APIs and CSS modules.
</li>
<li>
Enhancements and improvements to internationalization.
</li>
<li>
Continued integration of errata and bug fixes.
</li>
<li>
Integration of new and existing Web Platform technologies, including, but not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Hyperlinks</li>
<li>DOM APIs</li>
<li>Shadow DOM and Custom Elements</li>
<li>CSS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Integration with tools above and beyond browsers.</li>
<li>Improvements to the MathML markup and processing model to enhance accessibility and searchability.</li>
<li>Identification of normative requirements needed to ensure accessibility.</li>
<li>Removing elements and attributes from MathML that have had minimal adoption.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="section-out-of-scope">
  <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>

<ul>
<li>Changes that would cause legacy MathML that has significant usage to stop working on the Web Platform or elsewhere.</li>
<li>Significant changes to Content MathML. These will be considered at a later time after gaining experience and feedback from proposed additions to enhance accessibility and searchability in Presentation MathML.</li>

            Normative Specifications
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Working Group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt id="mathml-core1" class="spec"><a href="#">MathML Core Level 1</a></dt>
            <dd>
<p>This specification provides an initial integration into the Web Platform with increased implementation details, focusing on a subset of MathML 3 which has had wide implementation and fits well with the platform. It details and relies on automated Web Platform tests to improve MathML interoperability. It provides the core layer of MathML support upon which MathML 4 can build. Authors can implement remaining features, or more generally extend MathML Core, using modern web technologies (e.g., by polyfills).</p>


              <p class="draft-status"><b>Draft state:</b>  <a href="https://mathml-refresh.github.io/mathml-core/">Final Community Group Editors' Draft</a></p>
              <p class="milestone"><b>Expected completion:</b> Q2 2021</p>
    </dd>




            <dt id="mathml-core2" class="spec"><a href="#">MathML Core Level 2</a></dt>
            <dd>
<p>This specification will address some features left out of Level 1 due to time and implementation constraints. It will provide guidance on improving MathML within the evolving Web Platform and enhancing the descriptions of generally polyfilling or extending MathML, using technologies such as a Shadow DOM, Custom Elements, the CSS Layout API or other Houdini APIs. It will also address questions such as linking and accessibility through suggested accessibility mappings of elements and attributes.
</p>

<p>The MathML Core specifications are intended to define only those parts of MathML that are, or will be, implemented by all major browser engines.</p>


              <p class="draft-status"><b>Draft state:</b> No draft </p>
  </dd>


            <dt id="mathml4" class="spec"><a href="#">MathML 4</a></dt>
            <dd>
<p>This specification will overhaul the existing MathML 3 specification, rebasing it on MathML Core Level 1. It will deprecate, make obsolete, or drop features that are not used and likely will not be used. 
It will add attributes that allow specification of mathematical intent on Presentation MathML elements to enhance accessibility and searchability of math.</p>

        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/process/charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of

        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted using documents that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Math">Math Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Math Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/mathml-refresh/mathml/issues">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from 10 to 20 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
