          Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) describes graphics in a way that is scalable to different device resolutions
          in a manner that is accessible, stylable, and scriptable.

          Scope
        </h2>
        <p>
          The SVG WG maintains the deliverables listed in this charter. They consist of the following technologies, all
          of which are in scope for the SVG Working Group:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A <dfn>syntax</dfn> for retained-model structured graphics. Both XML and HTML syntaxes are supported and
          CSS is used for styling.
          </li>
          <li>A <dfn>rendering model</dfn> which describes how SVG elements are rendered.
          </li>
          <li>An <dfn>object model</dfn> and set of APIs, to support scripting and user interaction.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The SVG WG's focus in this charter period is on <em>maintenance</em> and <em>interoperability testing</em> of
          the core SVG 2 specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a secondary focus, the group may address modules for new graphical features for SVG, once there is broad
          consensus on adding each such feature to the Web Platform. The SVG Community Group (and also any other fora,
          such as WICG) will incubate new proposals. Once an incubated proposal is implemented and available (in
          nightly or testing builds) in at least one major browser, and has support from other SVG implementers, it may
          be adopted by the SVG Working Group. A requirements document will be used to collect together these features.

                This specification defines the features and syntax for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) Version 2. SVG is
                a language based on XML for describing two-dimensional vector and mixed vector/raster graphics. SVG
                content is stylable, scalable to different display resolutions, and can be viewed stand-alone, mixed
                with HTML content, or embedded using XML namespaces within other XML languages. SVG also supports
                dynamic changes; script can be used to create interactive documents, and animations can be performed
                using declarative animation features or by using script.

          implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for
          implementers, Web authors, and end users.
        </p>
        <p>
          There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts,
          including ways specification features can be used to address them, and recommendations for maximizing
          accessibility in implementations.

          The SVG WG will follow a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html">test as you commit</a>

        </p>

        <p>
          The Working Group is expected to have a Chair and member and non-member contributors acting as maintainers
          for the specifications. The Chair is expected to guide contributors on how to make changes to the
          specifications, and, where appropriate, to make sure fixes to the specification have an accompanying web
          platform test.
        </p>
        <p>
          Support from two or more web platform implementers is required before a substantive change can be made to a
          specification. This is enforced by a pull request template on GitHub, which Editors must fill out as a public
          record before a substantive contribution can be merged. The template will require implementers to give public
          support for a change and, where possible, provide a link to a public bug tracker for an implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as
          described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their
          agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants in the group are required (by the <a href=

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href=

          teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and
          issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public.
          Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit
          direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and

        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of

          such a discussion.

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an
          editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of
          the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful
          consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision
          along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication
          decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for
          consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based
          survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>one week to 10 working days</span>, depending on the
          chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised by the end of the
          response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes
          available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C
