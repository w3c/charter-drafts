          <h2>Goals</h2>
          <p>The Web Authentication Working Group will develop recommendation-track specifications defining  an API, as well as signature and attestation formats which provide an asymmetric and symmetric cryptography-based foundation for  authentication of users to Web Applications.</p><p>
          
          Overall goals include obviating the use of shared secrets, i.e. passwords, as authentication credentials, facilitating multi-factor authentication support as well as hardware-based key storage while respecting the Same Origin Policy (SOP) by default and allowing for explicit, constrained SOP relaxation.
          </p>
          
          </section>
          <section id="scope" class="scope">
            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p>
      The Working Group will determine use cases that the API needs to support and use these to derive requirements. Success will be determined by the implementation of API features as defined in this section of the charter.
    </p><p>
      API Features in scope are: 
		  <ol>
		  <li> Requesting generation of multiple asymmetric key pairs within a specific scope (e.g., an origin) with crypto (signature and curve) agility and crypto parameter selection; 
		  <li> Proving that the browser has possession of a specific private key, where the proof can only be done within the scope of the key pair. In other words, authentication should obey the same origin policy; 
		  <li> Remote desktop (unattended operation) ability; 
		  <li> Ability to allow a non-modal UI; 
		  <li> Binding of ambient credentials; 
		  <li> Re-authentication from the discretion of the relying party; 
		  <li> Dynamic linking of authentication credentials; 
		  <li> Storing of private key(s); 
		  <li> Account recovery and/or credential backup options;
		  <li> Facilitate relying party adoption through additional API enhancements such as returning transport indications in assertions, a credential &ldquo;durability&rdquo; signal, and credential status feedback signaling from relying parties.
		  </ol>
    </p><p>
    Dependencies may exist on
    the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/credential-management-1/">Credential
    Management API</a> in
    the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/">W3C Web Application
    Security Working Group</a> along with the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-rd-20161004/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-rd-20161004.html">Client To Authenticator
    Protocol specification</a> in FIDO.
    </p><p>
    Note that the details of any user experience (such as prompts) will not be normatively specified, although they may be informatively specified for certain function calls.
    </p><p>
    The Web Authentication Working Group should aim to produce specifications that have wide deployment and should adopt, refine and when needed, extend, existing practices and community-driven draft specifications when possible. The APIs should integrate well with Web Applications and so should be developed in concert with Web Application developers and reviewed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/">Web Application Security</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/">Web Applications</a> Working Groups.
    </p><p>
    Comprehensive test suites should be developed for the specification to ensure interoperability. User-centric privacy considerations of device management and credentials should be taken into account. The Working Group may produce protocol standards as needed by the API.

	  <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification.</p>
	  <p>Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
	</section>

  <section id="coordination">
    <h2>Coordination</h2>
<p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>
	  
<p>This API should work with a wide variety of authenticators and should not require non-standardized vendor-specific infrastructure. We will establish liaisons with the
other standards bodies working on particular authenticators as needed.</p>

    <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Working Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Webauthn">Web Authentication Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Web Authentication Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work through a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webauthn">GitHub repository</a> and on the public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-webauthn@w3.org">public-webauthn@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webauthn/">archive</a>). The public is invited to raise issues on GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
