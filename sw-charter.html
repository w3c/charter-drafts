        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>Web Applications traditionally assume that the network is reachable, which is not always the case.
          The Working Group will specify event-driven services between the network layer and the application,
          allowing it to handle network requests gracefully even while offline.

          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants
          for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification,
          and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification.
          The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute
          half of a working day per week towards the Working Group.
          There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories,

           meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review,

          Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository,

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301//#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>).
          For technical decisions, an editor or other participant typically makes an initial proposal,
          which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers,
          and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
          If consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented
          but a decision is necessary for timely progress, the Chairs may call for a vote,
          in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>
          and the process for asynchronous resolution described in the following paragraphs
          in which case they will record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#transition-reqs">requests for transition of document states</a> decisions
          taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any resolution taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference is to be considered <em>provisional</em>
          until 10 (ten) working days after the publication of the resolutions in meeting minutes
          on the working group's mailing list.
        </p>
        <p>
          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions not proposed at a teleconference or face to face meeting
          with a response period of at least one week, based on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period,
          the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available,
          or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.

          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

          <p>The Service Workers specification was originally chartered as a deliverable of the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/">Web Applications Working Group</a> in its

            into the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/10/webplatform-charter.html#deliverables">Web Platform Working Group</a>, the deliverable was maintained in its
