The <strong>mission</strong> of the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">Decentralized Identifier Working Group</a>
is to maintain the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a>
specification and related Working Group Notes. The WG will also seek consensus
around the best way to achieve effective interoperability, possibly through the
specification of DID Resolution and/or DID methods.

        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p>
The Working Group will maintain the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>
specification, which defines a new type of identifier that enables verifiable,
decentralized digital identity. This includes possible
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#correction-classes">class 1, 2, or 3 </a>
level changes on the Recommendation.
        </p>
        <p>
The Working Group will also seek consensus around DID Method specifications, and
may produce related documents.
        </p>
        <p>
The Working Group will begin working toward a specification for DID Resolution
and DID URL Dereferencing.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">

        <h2>Scope</h2>

        <p>Beyond the maintenance of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0</a> specification, the following, non-normative Working Group Notes will also be maintained by the Working Group:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/">DID Specification Registries</a>, including transitioning it from a WG Note to a <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#registries">W3C Registry</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-rubric/">DID Method Rubric</a>, including transitioning it from a WG Note to a <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#registries">W3C Registry</a>. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-cbor-representation/">The Plain CBOR representation</a>.

          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
The Working Group may also publish new Working Group Notes, Editors Drafts, or
Working Drafts for DID Resolution or DID URL Dereferencing, or of DID Method
Specifications. Any new documents intended for Recommendation will be
limited to the Working Draft maturity level.

    <!-- Testing and interop -->
	  <p>In order to advance to 
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a> or to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2023/Process-20230612/#change-review">incorporate candidate amendments</a>, each normative specification is expected to have 
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent interoperable
			  implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where
interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites, and two or
more implementations interoperating with each other. In order to advance to
Proposed Recommendation, each normative specification must have an open
test suite of every feature defined in the specification.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>

    <p>To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications
      in Candidate Recommendation
      or to features that have deployed implementations
      should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.
      Testing efforts should be conducted via the <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt">Web Platform Tests</a> project.</p>

    <!-- Horizontal review -->

    <p>Each specification should contain sections detailing 
    security and privacy implications for implementers, 
    Web authors, and end users, 
    as well as recommendations for mitigations.
    There should be a clear description of the residual risk 
    to the user or operator of that protocol 
    after threat mitigation has been deployed.</p>

    <!-- Design principles -->
    <p>This Working Group expects to follow the
    TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>.
    </p>
	
    <!-- Relevance and momentum -->
	  <p>All new features should be supported by at least two intents to implement before being incorporated in the specification.</p>

	</section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

          Communication

        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="">Decentralized Identifier Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Decentralized Identifier Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>

        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-did-wg@w3.org">public-did-wg@w3.org</a> ( <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/">archive</a>) or on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg/">GitHub issues</a> (and specification-specific GitHub repositories and issue trackers). The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>

        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>one week to 10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
