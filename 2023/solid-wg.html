        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p>It is common for web service providers to require users to surrender control over their own data, and store them in a way that is often restricted to certain systems, or can only be accessed by the applications that created it.</p>

        <p>Solid extends open web standards to give priority to individual and community autonomy, allowing them to keep authority over their identity, data, and privacy, and giving them the freedom to select applications and services that suit their needs.</p>

        <p>Solid defines the concept of storage (one feature of the construct informally referred to as Solid Pods), in which users place data and control access to it, and a suite of protocols for applications to use storages.</p>

        <p>Solid offers several advantages over more traditional architectures for data use by Web services today, including:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Storage is controlled by individuals or organizations, and can be delegated to other parties.</li>
          <li>Interoperability between applications and various storage server implementations of the protocol.</li>
          <li>A decentralized trust model enabling authentication and authorization mechanisms to operate at Web scale.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/solid">W3C Solid Community Group</a></cite> has been incubating <a href="https://solidproject.org/TR/">Technical Reports</a> since 2018 towards that end: <q cite="https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/solid">to describe the interoperability between different classes of products by using Web communication protocols, global identifiers, authentication and authorization mechanisms, data formats and shapes, notifications, and query interfaces.</q></p>

        <p>The wider Solid community has developed a <a href="https://solidproject.org/developers/tools/">suite of implementations, tools, and libraries</a> for developers, as well as <a href="https://solidproject.org/apps">applications</a> for users.</p>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
                The design approach for the <a href="https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol">Solid Protocol</a> will continue substantial efforts undertaken previously in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/solid">W3C Solid Community Group</a> to specify a set of interoperable protocol standards for enabling the use and development of Solid servers and applications across a <a href="https://github.com/solid/user-stories">wide range of use cases</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
                The Working Group will:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
                    Define a core protocol specification for the secure and efficient operation of Solid servers and the behavior of clients interacting with those servers.
          </li>
          <li>
                    Recommend a set of practices needed for data security for Solid storage, and for both server and client software, including use of appropriate authentication, authorization, access management lifecycle, verification, identity, and other standards, integrating existing outside efforts.

                        <p>
                            The Solid Protocol specification aims to provide applications with secure and permissioned access to externally stored data in an interoperable way. <q lang="en-GB" cite="https://solidproject.org/TR/2022/protocol-20221231#introduction">An overarching design goal of the Solid ecosystem is to be evolvable and to provide fundamental affordances for decentralised Web applications for information exchange in a way that is secure and privacy respecting. In this environment, actors allocate identifiers for their content, shape and store data where they have access to, set access controls, and use preferred applications and services to achieve them.</q>

                        <p>
                            When possible, the Solid Protocol will evolve while maintaining a high degree of compatibility with existing implementations, of both servers and clients, and with features from prior versions. If incompatible changes have to be made, then they will be done by introducing a stage where both old and new protocols are supported, to allow the implementors to upgrade their systems in a managed way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Solid Protocol may include protocol details for integration with identity layers and mechanisms; access management and data integrity; notifications about resource changes; and, authorization mechanisms.

                <p>
                    All specifications, regardless of their progress along the W3C Process line from First Public Working Draft to Recommendation, will indicate their version using the <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> scheme. The required versions of each dependency will be given in each specification.

	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>

    <!-- Testing and interop -->
	  <p>In order to advance to
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent interoperable
			  implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where
interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites, and two or
more implementations interoperating with each other. In order to advance to
Proposed Recommendation, each normative specification must have an open
test suite of every feature defined in the specification.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
    <p>To promote interoperability, the group will publish <a href="https://solidproject.org/ED/qa">Solid QA</a> detailing testing policy, processes, and procedures.</p>

    <!-- Horizontal review -->
    <p>Each specification should contain sections detailing security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
	  <p>Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
		recommendations for maximizing accessibility in implementations.</p>

    <!-- Design principles -->
    <p>This Working Group expects to follow the
    TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>.
    </p>
	</section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

          Communication
        </h2>
        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a class="todo" href="">Solid Working Group home page (LINK TBD).</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Solid Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work: on the public mailing list <a class="todo" id="public-name" href="mailto:public-solid-wg@w3.org">public-solid-wg@w3.org (LINK TBD)</a> (<a class="todo" href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-solid-wg/">archive (LINK TBD)</a>)
          or on <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/solid-wg/">GitHub issues (LINK TBD)</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>five to ten working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
