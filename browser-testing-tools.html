        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>The scope of the WebDriver Working Group
          includes APIs for the purpose of automating testing of Web applications
          running in browsers—for example, to simulate user actions such as
          clicking links, entering text, and submitting forms.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
          <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of each of feature defined in the specification.</p>
          <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing any known security or privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
        </div>
      </section>



      <section id="deliverables">
        <h2>
          Deliverables
        </h2>

        <p>More detailed milestones and updated publication schedules are available on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/[groupname]/PubStatus">group publication status page</a>.</p>

        <p>To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href='https://github.com/w3c/testing-how-to/#test-as-you-commit-pointer-event-whatwg-webperf'>tests</a>.</p>

        <p><i>Draft state</i> indicates the state of the deliverable at the time of the charter approval. <i>Expected completion</i> indicates when the deliverable is projected to become a Recommendation, or otherwise reach a stable state.</p>

            Normative Specifications
          </h3>
          <p>
            The WebDriver Working Group will revise the following W3C normative specification:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dl>
              <dt id="webdriver" class="spec"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/">WebDriver</a></dt>
            <dd>
      <p>
        WebDriver is a remote control interface that enables introspection and control of user agents. It provides a platform- and language-neutral wire protocol as a way for out-of-process programs to remotely instruct the behavior of web browsers.
            </p>

            Other Deliverables

            Other non-normative documents may be created such as:
          </p>
          <p>The WebDriver Working Group will also produce
            a test suite and implementation report for the WebDriver specification. It
            is expected that the implementation report will include results for
            implementation of the WebDriver API in at least four different browser
            engines:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Mozilla Gecko

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this WebDriver Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/Charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a> and at least 3 months before <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a>, and should be issued when major changes occur in a specification.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

      <section class="participation">
        <h2 id="participation">
          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this WebDriver Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute up to a quarter of a working day per week towards the WebDriver Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its document repositories and public mailing list, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
      </section>



      <section id="communication">
        <h2>
          Communication
        </h2>
        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this WebDriver Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="">WebDriver Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most WebDriver Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/webdriver">GitHub</a> and on the public
          mailing list <a href="mailto:public-browser-tools-testing@w3.org">public-browser-tools-testing@w3.org</a>
          (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-browser-tools-testing/">archive</a>).
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.
        </p>
      </section>



      <section id="decisions">
        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the WebDriver Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
