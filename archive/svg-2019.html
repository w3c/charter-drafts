        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a language that allows authors and
          users to describe graphics in a way which is scalable to different
          device resolutions, acessible, and animatable.</p>
        <p>The SVG WG develops the SVG specifications. They
          consist of the following, somewhat independent technologies, all of
          which are in scope for the SVG Working Group: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>syntax</strong> for retained-model structured graphics.
            Both XML and HTML5 syntaxes are suported. <strong>Styling
              characteristics</strong> are CSS properties, expressed as
            stylesheets or as presentation attributes.</li>
          <!--
        <li>A <strong>processing model</strong></li>        -->
          <li>A <strong>rendering model</strong> which describes how the
            elements of SVG produce a graphical representation</li>
          <li>An <strong>Object Model</strong>, a set of standard APIs, to
            which libraries can be written for manipulating dynamic and
            responsive graphics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a primary focus in this charter period, the group will concentrate
          on the <em>stabilisation</em> and <em>interoperability testing</em>
          of the core SVG 2 specification. As part of that testing, features
          which are in the reference draft of SVG2 and which do not meet the
          stability and interoperability requirements for a Proposed
          Recommendation may be moved to separate specification modules, work on
          which would remain in scope, but at a lower priority.</p>
          <p>As a secondary focus, the group may address modules for new graphical
            features for SVG,
            <!-- <em>only</em> once SVG 2 is at the Proposed
            Recommendation stage and  -->
            once there is broad consensus on adding each
            such feature to the Web Platform. The SVG Community Group (and also any other fora, such as WICG) will incubate new proposals. Once an incubated proposal is implemented and available (in nightly or testing builds) in at least
            one major browser, and has support from other SVG implementers, it may be
            adopted by the SVG Working Group. A requirements document will be used
            to collect together these features.
          </p>

        <div id="section-out-of-scope">
          <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
            <p>The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this Working group.</p>

            <ul class="out-of-scope">
              <li>changes to the HTML parsing algorithm</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
          <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of each of feature defined in the specification.</p>
          <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
          <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
          <p>
            Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
            recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>
          <p> Modules that reach <a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#rec-publication"
            title="Recommendation">W3C
            Recommendation</a>, are considered successful when all of the
          following are present: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Production of stable documents addressing the work items listed
            in the Deliverables section.</li>
          <li>Test suites for each module with conformance criteria.</li>
          <li>Availability of multiple, independent, interoperable
            implementations of each feature with conformance criteria in each
            deliverable; as demonstrated by an implementation report
            (summarizing implementation status against the relevant test
            suite) for each testable class of product, including user agents.</li>
          <li>Deployment on multiple types of platform.</li>
          <li>User community and industry adoption of the group deliverables.</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html">
          <p>All normative spec changes are generally expected to have a corresponding pull request in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests">web-platform-tests</a>, either in the form of new tests or modifications to existing tests, or must include the rationale for why test updates are not required for the proposed update.</p>

          <p>Typically, both pull requests (spec updates and tests) will be merged at the same time. If a pull request for the specification is approved but the other needs more work, add the '<a href="https://w3c.github.io/spec-labels.html" rel="nofollow">needs tests</a>' label or, in web-platform-tests, the '<a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=label%3Astatus%3Aneeds-spec-decision%20">status:needs-spec-decision</a>' label. Note that a test change that contradicts the specification should not be merged before the corresponding specification change.</p>

          <p>If testing is not practical due to web-platforms-tests limitations, please explain why and if appropriate file an issue with the '<a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=label%3Atype%3Auntestable%20">type:untestable</a>' label to follow up later.</p>

                <p>This specification defines the core SVG language, as currently
                  implemented in Web browsers. It includes a definition of how
                  ARIA is used in SVG. This specification updates SVG 1.1 to
                  add non-XML parsing (as defined by HTML), removes the XLink namespace,
                  and makes many small improvements in clarity and precision in
                  the specification.</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the (Working|Interest) Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.

          Communication
        </h2>
        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p> Information about the group (including details about deliverables,
          issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available
          from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/Main_Page">SVG
            Working Group home page.</a> </p>

        <p> Most SVG Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of
          particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed
          basis. </p>

        <p> This group primarily conducts its technical work on <a id="github-issues" href="https://github.com/w3c/svgwg/issues">GitHub
            issues</a>. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute
          to this work. </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

      <section id="decisions">
        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
