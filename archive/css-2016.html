      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>

<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language that allows
authors and users to attach style (e.g., from fonts and spacing to
filter effects and style animations) to structured documents (e.g., HTML
documents and XML applications). By separating the presentation style of
documents from the content of documents, CSS simplifies Web authoring
and site maintenance. It supports media-specific style so that authors
may tailor the presentation of their documents to visual browsers, aural
devices, printers, braille devices, handheld devices, etc.

        </p><p>The CSS WG develops the following, somewhat independent
          technologies, all of which are in scope for the CSS Working Group:

        </p><ul>
          <li>A <strong>syntax</strong> for associating information
            with elements in a structured resource, in particular HTML
            and SVG documents. The main part of the syntax consists of
            rules that associate properties + values with selectors
            where the selectors are expressions that match elements in
            the structured document, based on their position in the
            document or based on other information about the elements
            (their type, what the user has done with them, etc.)

          </li><li>A <strong>processing model,</strong> referred to as
            “cascading and inheritance,” that ensures that, given
            one or more style sheets and a structured document, each
            element in the document is associated with the full set of
            properties and values, no matter how short the style sheets
            or how long the document.

          </li><li>A <strong>rendering model,</strong> part of which is a
            model of typography, i.e., a layout model for text
            documents, possibly with embedded other objects and
            possibly involving several documents simultaneously.
            The model describes blocks and lines of text, characters,
            columns, colors, dynamic effects, etc. Another
            part is rendering to speech. It also
            includes the presentation and behavior of UI widgets. CSS's
            influence over UI controls is limited to defining shortcut
            keys, the look of controls in various states during
            interaction (valid/invalid, required, inactive, etc.),
            hiding/unhiding, and other local behaviors, but CSS does
            not itself change the state of elements and does not define
            how (form) elements interact with a server. (The general
            principle is that CSS can enhance the user's interaction
            with a document, but the document is functional without
            it.)

          </li><li>The <strong>CSS Object Model,</strong> a set of standard
            APIs, to which libraries can be written for manipulating
            style sheets and documents with associated style
            information.
        </li></ul>
		
		    <p>
          The CSS WG not only develops CSS, but also checks that
          properties needed by other working groups and which could
          occur in a style sheet together with CSS properties, are
          compatible with CSS in general and consistent in their naming
          schemes. This affects properties such as those of SVG and
          Device Independence (such as media features), but not
          properties such as those in STTS nor the presentation
          attributes of XSL, SVG or DFXP.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part of the work of the working group is also to develop
          test suites for the various specifications it publishes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another part is to maintain errata and, when needed, publish
          revised versions of the various specifications.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
          <p>
            The CSS Working Group's work is considered a success if there are multiple independent complete and interoperable implementations of its deliverables that are widely used. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsCR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have at least two independent implementations of each of feature defined in the specification.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each specification should contain a section detailing any known security or privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each specification should contain a section describing known impacts to accessibility and users with disabilities, ways the specification features address them, and recommendations for minimizing accessibility problems in implementation and use of such features.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specifications that reach <a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#rec-publication" title="Recommendation">W3C Recommendation</a>, are considered successful when:
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Production of stable documents addressing the work items listed in the Deliverables section.</li>
              <li>Test suites for each deliverable with conformance criteria.</li>
              <li>Availability of multiple, independent, interoperable implementations of each feature with conformance criteria in each deliverable; as demonstrated by an implementation report (summarizing implementation status against the relevant test suite) for each testable class of product, including user agents.</li>
              <li>Deployment on multiple types of platform (traditional computers, phones, tablets, accessibility aids, print formatters, and so on).</li>
              <li>User community and industry adoption of the group deliverables.</li> 
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>


      <section id="deliverables">
        <h2>
          Deliverables

        <p>More detailed milestones and updated publication schedules are available on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work">group publication status page</a>.</p>

        <p><i>Draft state</i> indicates the state of the deliverable at the time of the charter approval. <i>Expected completion</i> indicates when the deliverable is projected to become a Recommendation, or otherwise reach a stable state.</p>

          <p>This list is not exclusive: The WG may also create new specifications, within its scope.</p>

    <p>Selectors are patterns that match against elements in a tree, and as such form one of several technologies that can be used to select nodes in an XML document. Selectors have been optimized for use with HTML and XML, and are designed to be usable in performance-critical code. They are a core component of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which uses Selectors to bind style properties to elements in the document.

  <dt id="filter-effects" class="spec">filter-effects
  <dd>
    <p>Filter effects are a way of processing an element’s rendering before it is displayed in the document. Typically, rendering an element via CSS or SVG can be conceptually described as if the element, including its children, are drawn into a buffer (such as a raster image) and then that buffer is composited into the elements parent. Filters apply an effect before the compositing stage. Examples of such effects are blurring, changing color intensity and warping the image.

        <p class="issue"><b>Issue:</b> The paragraph above replaces line-item liaisons and dependencies with individual horizontal groups. There's been a suggestion to name and individually link the specific horizontal groups inline, instead of pointing to a page that lists them.</p>
        <p class="issue"><b>Issue:</b> The requirement for an invitation to review after FPWD and before CR may seem a bit overly restrictive, but it only requires an invitation, not a review, a commitment to review, or even a response from the horizontal group.

In addition to decisions made on teleconferences or face to face meetings, decisions may also be made by a call for consensus on the public mailing list; consensus to be determined by the chairs after some reasonable interval for objections. This avoids waiting for the next weekly call, if consensus can be determined before then.
