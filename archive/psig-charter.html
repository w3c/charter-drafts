<h1 id="title">2019 DRAFT Patents and Standards Interest Group Charter</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/pp/psig/">Patent and Standards Interest
Group (PSIG)</a> is designed as a forum for W3C Members to discuss matters
regarding the W3C Patent Policy as well as W3C copyright in particular and
larger issues regarding patents, licenses and Web standards. The PSIG is an
Interest Group that gives feedback to the W3C Team, the Advisory Board and the
Advisory Committee; PSIG does not make final policy decisions on behalf of W3C.

<h2 id="background">Overview and Background</h2>

<p>In May 2003, the W3C Director, on the advice of the W3C Membership, approved
the W3C Patent Policy as the governing document for patent matters in W3C
Recommendations. The Patent Policy Working Group (PPWG), which developed that
policy over a more than three year period, assisted the Team with the
implementation of the policy, and the PPWG then closed. </p>

<p>The W3C Patent Policy affirms and strengthens the basic patent licensing
model that has driven innovation on the Web from its inception. The
availability of an interoperable, unencumbered (i.e. royalty-free) Web
infrastructure provides an expanding foundation for innovative applications,
profitable commerce, and the free flow of information and ideas. The W3C Patent
Policy encourages both commercial and non-commercial implementations of W3C
Recommendations. Beyond establishing a commitment to royalty-free standards,
the Patent Policy provides W3C with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a stable, practical, written policy for all W3C Recommendations</li>
  <li>a clear licensing framework for all W3C Recommendations</li>
  <li>consistent patent disclosure obligations, and</li>
  <li>an exception-handling process when problems arise.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Patents and Standards Interest Group (PSIG) was formed in December 2004
to provide an ongoing forum for discussion of general issues regarding
implementation of the Patent Policy and to exchange views on Intellectual
Property Rights (IPR). Upon request, PSIG continues to provide feedback on
whether changes to the Patent Policy are desirable and how those changes might
look.</p>

<p>Over time, PSIG has been asked for feedback on a variety of non-patent
questions. For example, PSIG opinions helped the W3C Team define the Community
Group Licensing Agreement. In the discussion around HTML5 licensing, PSIG
helped the Advisory Board evaluate licensing alternatives. </p>

<p>This PSIG Charter continues the established practice for PSIG to
discuss and provide feedback on IPR matters. This Charter also permits the PSIG
to draft or suggest amended or additional patent policy documents.</p>
</div>

<div class="mission">
<h2 id="mission">Mission Statement</h2>

<p>PSIG is a forum for W3C Members and Invited Experts to discuss and provide
feedback to the W3C Team, the Advisory Board and the Advisory Committee on IPR
questions. </p>

<p>PSIG may suggest further policy development and draft documents for
such additional policies. Any policy development would be subject to
Advisory Committee and Director review. </p>
</div>

<div class="scope">
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>The W3C Team, Advisory Board and Advisory Committee may request
that the PSIG provide feedback regarding the W3C Patent Policy, issues related to patent commitments for participants in current and proposed W3C activities (for example, Evergreen Standards<super><a href="#FN1" name="Evergreen">[1]</a></super>), and other IPR issues.
The PSIG may
also exchange views and flag issues regarding the W3C Patent Policy.
It may produce non-binding Interest Group Notes on those specific
issues. </p>

<p>The PSIG will review, but is not responsible for formally documenting or
implementing, W3C IPR policies.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

<p>As an Interest Group, the PSIG issues neither Recommendations nor other
binding policy documents. It may draft policy documents or amendments to existing policy documents for Advisory Comittee review. </p>

<p>The PSIG is responsible for recommending wording for the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/2003/12/22-pp-faq">Patent Policy FAQ</a>. The PSIG reviews
proposed entries to it as follows: The initiative to add a FAQ entry may start
with either the Team or the PSIG. If it starts with the Team, the Team proposes
the FAQ entry to the PSIG. One PSIG Chair must reply within <strong>7
days</strong> with one of these two dispositions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>PSIG heads-up. If the entry is likely uncontroversial, the PSIG Chair(s)
    forwards the proposal to the PSIG list with a comment deadline of
    <strong>14 days</strong>. Unless someone on the PSIG objects within 14
    days, then the proposal may be added to the FAQ by the Team on the 15th
    day. If there is an objection from the PSIG, then it will be added to the
    PSIG agenda for discussion.</li>
  <li>PSIG Agenda. If the proposal raises some substantial issue in the
    judgment of the PSIG Chair(s), then it will be sent to the PSIG list for
    comment and discussion will be scheduled for the next PSIG teleconference.
    After that, the PSIG will report back on the results.</li>
</ul>

<p>The PSIG shall report at least annually to the Advisory Committee on its
activities identifying issues resolved or unresolved.</p>
</div>

<div class="dependencies">
<h2 id="coordination">Dependencies</h2>

<p>The PSIG will coordinate with the W3C Advisory Board, the Advisory Committee
and the W3C Team on IPR matters raised. During considerations and as needed,
PSIG can informally liaise with the relevant institutions in the standards and
public policy communities around the world. Informal coordination is done via
the Interest Group's mailing lists. </p>
</div>

<div class="participation">
<h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>

<p>Any W3C Member may nominate up to 3 participants to the PSIG. The Chair(s)
may invite qualified Invited Experts to participate in the PSIG in accordance
with the Invited Expert provisions in the Process Document.</p>

<p>To the extent that PSIG participants are attorneys, they shall not be deemed
to provide legal advice to W3C. Discussions, even about legal topics and while
focused on a use case, are mere discussions and do not represent a legal
opinion, express or implied. </p>
</div>

<div class="communication">
<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

<p>The Patents and Standards Interest Group is a Member-only forum. PSIG
mailing lists and their archives are Member-accessible. The Interest Group
functions primarily through an email discussion list hosted by W3C. The main
PSIG list is &lt;member-psig@w3.org&gt; with a Member accessible <a
href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/member-psig/">archive</a>. It is
expected that face-to-face meetings will take place on the order of once or
twice each year, or as necessary, at the discretion of the Chair(s).</p>

<p>The Interest Group communicates in English.</p>

<p>Information about the group is available from the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/2004/pp/psig/">Patents and Standards Interest Group
home page</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="decisions">
<h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>

<p>As explained in the Process Document (<a
href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">section
3.3</a>), this group will seek to give feedback when there is consensus. When
the Chair(s) puts a question and observes dissent, after due consideration of
different opinions, the Chair(s) shall record any objections and a decision
(possibly after a formal vote), and move on. <a
href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">Section 3.4,
Votes</a> of the W3C Process Document applies. </p>
</div>

<div class="patent">
<h2 id="patentpolicy">Patent Policy</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/pp/psig/">Patents and Standards Interest
Group</a> provides an opportunity to share perspectives on the topic addressed
by this charter. While the Interest Group does not produce Recommendation-track
documents, when Interest Group participants review Recommendation-track
specifications from Working Groups, the disclosure obligations set out in <a
href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy do apply.</p>

<p>For more information about disclosure obligations for this group, please see
the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/">W3C Patent Policy
Implementation</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="about">About this Charter</h2>

Team. </p>
