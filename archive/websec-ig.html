      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>As the Web Platform around HTML5 emerges as a platform for sophisticated application development, security properties of both implementations and specifications become critical. This group provides a forum for technology designers, implementors, and other interested parties to work toward improving specifications and implementations to advance security of the Web overall. The group is, in particular, focused on the security properties of HTML5 and related APIs and technologies.</p>
      </section>


      <section id="deliverables">
        <h2>
          Deliverables
        </h2>
	<p>As an Interest Group, this group has no formal deliverables. The group may propose additional
 	   standards work to the W3C and may publish Interest Group Notes on topics such as best
	   practices, analysis of security issues, and design considerations.</p>
	<p>The Group intends to focus its work on three categories of effort:
	  <ul><li>Incubation: Discussing ideas for new Recommendation-track work; dispatching
		  promising ideas to a Community Group or Task Force; proposing drafts to W3C
		  for Working Group chartering.
	    <li>Horizontal Reviews: Assessing W3C drafts for security considerations and/or
		   publishing questionnaires or other guidance to enable self-review by working groups.
	    <li>Web Security Incident Review: Considering reported security incidents as
		    input, e.g., to correct patterns of error, threat modeling, and new spec development.
	      	</ul>
	      </p>

</p><p>
There are no minimum requirements for participation in this group: This IG is composed of the participants in the public-web-security@w3.org mailing list.

        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.

      <section id="decisions">
        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Interest Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
        </p>
      </section>



      <section id="patentpolicy">
        <h2>Patent Disclosures </h2>
        <p>The Interest Group provides an opportunity to
          share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
          Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
          disclosure obligations as set out in <a shape="rect" href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
            6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
          produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
          participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
          Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply. For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
          please see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/">W3C
