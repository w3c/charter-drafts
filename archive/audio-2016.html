        <section id="scope" class="scope">
            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p>Building upon and expanding the basic functionalities brought by HTML5's <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> media elements and <code>MediaStream</code> object, the Audio Working Group defines client-side script APIs
                which support the features required by rich interactive applications including the ability to process and synthesize audio streams directly in script, as well as giving access to musical instruments through a bridge with existing system-level
                MIDI APIs.</p>

            <p>The audio API provides methods to read audio samples, write audio data, create sounds, and perform client-side audio processing and synthesis with minimal latency. It also adds programmatic access to the PCM audio stream for low-level manipulation
                directly in script. This API can be used for interactive applications, games, 3D environments, musical applications, educational applications, and for the purposes of accessibility. It includes the ability to synchronize, visualize, or
                enhance sound information when used in conjunction with graphics APIs. Sound synthesis can be used to enhance user interfaces, or produce music. The addition of advanced audio capabilities to user agents presents new options to Web developers
                and designers, and has many accessibility opportunities and challenges that this working group will continue to keep in mind.</p>

            <p>In addition to an audio processing API, this group has received feedback from the audio and music community and industry, who wish to Web-enable their MIDI-capable devices. <abbr title="Musical Instrument Digital Interface">MIDI</abbr> is
                an electronic device interface, developed by the musical instrument industry, that includes communication protocols for two-way connection and control of a wide variety of devices, including digital musical instruments, digital audio workstations,
                lighting sytems, game controllers, and many other systems. The MIDI specification has wide adoption and interoperable deployment across devices and computer operating systems, and to extend this existing infrastructure, the Audio Working
                Group is also developing a specification to create a bridge between the browser and existing system-level MIDI APIs, to make musical instruments first-class citizens of the Web.</p>

            <p>The scope of this working group includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developing a client-side script API for processing and synthesizing PCM audio streams, including direct scripted solutions.</li>
                <li>Access to audio devices, such as for microphones or other audio inputs, and multi-channel speakers or other audio outputs.</li>
                <li>APIs and advanced functionality regarding audio cache management and audio capability information.</li>
                <li>Defining a client-side script API for accessing and manipulating MIDI-capable devices available on the users' systems.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This working group will take into account common work-flows for sound creators, including considerations for common audio formats. This group will also liaise with other groups for direct connection to audio inputs, such as microphones and
                speakers.

                        <p>The audio API is intended to operate on local and remote sources including synthesis, files, and sound-capture sources. APIs for implementing interactive audio streaming directly between users is not in scope. </p>

                    <dd>
                        <p>This specification describes a high-level JavaScript API for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications. The primary paradigm is of an audio routing graph, where a number of AudioNode objects are connected together to
                            define the overall audio rendering. The actual processing will primarily take place in the underlying implementation (typically optimized Assembly / C / C++ code), but direct JavaScript processing and synthesis is also supported.

                Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for
                public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a <a href="https://github.com/WebAudio">public GitHub repository</a>,
                and permit direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
            </p>
            <p>
                Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/audio/wiki/Main_Page">Audio Working Group wiki.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Most Audio Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
            </p>
            <p>
                This group primarily conducts its technical work on <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="https://github.com/WebAudio">GitHub issues</a>. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
            </p>
            <p>
                The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
            <p>
                This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/policies#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant
                makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
            <p>
                However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
            </p>
            <p>
                To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions
                (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the
                end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
            </p>
            <p>
                All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
            </p>
            <p>
                This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
