      Goals
    </h2>
    <p>
      A group to gather and incubate new features and requirements for SVG —
      making it easier for software developers and content creators in the SVG community
      to engage with the SVG standardization process.
    </p>
    <p>
      This group will complement the SVG working group,
      and covers the same scope of technologies.
      Draft proposals for new SVG features, developed in the community group,
      may transition to recommendation-track specifications in the working group.
    </p>
    <h2 id="scope-of-work"><a class="permalink" href="#scope-of-work">§</a>
      Scope of Work
    </h2>
    <p>
      The community group will support
      the standardization and adoption of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
      through three types of work:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Incubating proposed specifications for extensions and integrations to SVG.
      </li>
      <li>Compiling non-normative reports
        about current and potential uses of SVG and vector graphics.
      </li>
      <li>Hosting projects for developing SVG-related software.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      SVG is a set of interelated technologies used to create vector graphics.
      The scope of SVG for the community group is as defined in the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/svg-2019.html#scope">SVG working group charter</a>,
      including its
      markup syntax, styling characteristics, rendering model, and object model.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incubate, in the context of a proposed specification, means to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Connect interested stakeholders,
        including content creators and software implementers
      </li>
      <li>Collect use cases, requirements, and related information
        for defining the scope and purpose of potential features
      </li>
      <li>Identify any implementation concerns,
        including security, privacy, accessibility, and internationalization impacts
      </li>
      <li>Draft and refine specification text
      </li>
      <li>Gather feedback and track issues and suggestions
      </li>
      <li>Develop test cases and other examples
        of how the specification should be implemented
      </li>
      <li>Optionally, build experimental implementations
        and related software to demonstrate the proposal's potential
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      After successful incubation,
      a proposed specification would be ready for transition
      to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/Process-20190301/#Reports">W3C technical report process</a>
      (AKA, the “recommendation track”).
    </p>
    <p>
      See <a href="#deliverables">Deliverables</a> for examples of in-scope work.
    </p>

    <h3 id="out-of-scope"><a class="permalink" href="#out-of-scope">§</a>
      Out of Scope
    </h3>
    <p>
      Any normative specification being actively developed
      by the SVG working group,
      or other recommendation-track group,
      is out of scope for the community group.
    </p>
    <p>
      A feature proposal is not in scope for community group
      if that feature has multiple independent, non-experimental implementations
      shipping in consumer-oriented software
      (that is, not including preview or “Nightly” versions of the software,
      or implementations requiring special opt-in to the feature).
      If new implementations make a feature become out-of-scope,
      any proposed specification for that feature
      <em>should</em> be transitioned to a recommendation-track process
      as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, inactive proposals from the working group
      <em>are</em> in scope for incubation in the community group.
      For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Draft specifications that have been dropped
        from the working group's charter deliverables
      </li>
      <li>
        Features that were previously described in a recommendation-track specification,
        but which have been removed or deferred
        (for example, because there were not two interoperable implementations)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="deliverables"><a class="permalink" href="#deliverables">§</a>

    <h3 id="specifications"><a class="permalink" href="#specifications">§</a>
      Specifications
    </h3>
    <p>
      Because the community group is designed to provide a forum
      to discuss new proposals for SVG,
      this charter cannot exhaustively list all possible specifications
      which could be incubated.
      However, the following draft specifications and features
      have previously been developed by the SVG working group,
      but are not currently in its charter scope,
      and are therefore available for incubation in the community group:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://dev.w3.org/SVG/modules/param/master/SVGParam.html">SVG Parameters</a>
      </li>

      </li>
      <li><a href="https://svgwg.org/specs/transform/"><code>svg:transform</code> for Mapping</a>
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://svgwg.org/specs/markers/">SVG Markers</a>
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://svgwg.org/specs/paths/">SVG Paths</a> (API and advanced commands)
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://svgwg.org/specs/strokes/">SVG Strokes</a>,
        other than those features being standardized through
        the <a href="https://drafts.fxtf.org/fill-stroke-3/">CSS Fill and Stroke Module Level 3</a>
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://svgwg.org/svg-next/painting.html#SpecifyingPaint">The <code>child</code> syntax for defining references to graphical elements.</a>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are no specific timelines for any of these projects,
      as of the date this charter was drafted.
    </p>
    <h3 id="non-normative-reports"><a class="permalink" href="#non-normative-reports">§</a>
      Non-Normative Reports
    </h3>
    <p>
      The group may produce other Community Group Reports,
      that are within the scope of this charter but that are not Specifications,
      for instance use cases, requirements, white papers, or best-practices guides.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular,
      the draft <a href="https://w3c.github.io/svgwg/specs/svg-authoring/">SVG Authoring Guide</a>
      could be completed under the scope of the community group.
      Separate best practice guides could provide guidance for SVG authoring tools
      and other software that exports or manipulates SVG files.
      Use-case and requirements reports could review
      how SVG and other vector graphics languages are being used,
      separate from any specification proposal.
    </p>
    <h3 id="test-suites"><a class="permalink" href="#test-suites">§</a>
      Test Suites and Other Software
    </h3>
    <p>
      Participants developing draft specifications in the community group
      <em>should</em> include matching test suites.
      For organizational purposes,
      the test suite is considered part of the same project
      as the proposed specification.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group <em>may</em> host other open-source software projects that support SVG standardization,
      including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Polyfills (<a href="https://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill">definition</a>),
        preprocessors, and other software
        for adapting SVG code that uses new or proposed features
        to work in current or historical user agents.
      </li>
      <li>
        Debugging and authoring tools
        (stand-alone or as extensions to existing software)
        to make it easier for content creators to use SVG,
        including tools that promote best practices with existing SVG technologies,
        tools to support the adoption of new features,
        and tools for experimenting with feature proposals.
      </li>
      <li>
        Examples, demonstrations, and educational content
        about SVG features (existing or proposed).
      </li>
      <li>
        Tools to support the development of the specifications,
        test suites,
        and other software
        of the community group and the SVG working group.
      </li>

    <p>
      This community group is tightly affilliated with
      the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/Main_Page">SVG Working Group</a>.
      Its work may intersect with the work of any of the other groups
      mentioned in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/svg-2019.html#coordination">“Coordination” section</a>
      of the SVG working group's charter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, many projects will need to be coordinated with
      the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS Working Group</a>.
      All projects will need to consider guidelines
      produced by the W3C's horizontal review groups:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">WAI Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group</a> (for accessibility)</li>

      Community and Business Group Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group operates under the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/">Community and Business
      Group Process</a>. Terms in this Charter that conflict with those of the
      Community and Business Group Process are void.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing
      commitments under the <a href=
      'http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/'>W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>. When people request to
      participate without representing their organization's legal interests,
      W3C will in general approve those requests for this group with the
      following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an organizational
      commitment under the CLA starting with the individual's first request to
      make a contribution to a group <a href="#deliverables">Deliverable</a>.
      The section on <a href="#contrib">Contribution Mechanics</a> describes
      how W3C expects to monitor these contribution requests.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">W3C Code of
      Ethics and Professional Conduct</a> applies to participation in
      this group.

      Organization</h3>

    <p>
      Technical work of the community group
      will be divided into individual projects,
      where a project may be one of the following types
      of <a href="#deliverables">deliverables</a>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a proposed specification,
        along with its test suite
        and any use-cases/requirements
        or other non-normative reports to support the specification proposal
      </li>
      <li>a non-normative report</li>
      <li>a software project</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each active group project —
      meaning, a project where work is ongoing
      and contributions are accepted —
      <em>must</em> have clearly identified project lead(s)
      who are responsible for that project's process and deliverables.
      If the project is a proposed specification,
      the project leads include the specification editors.
      If at any time an active project no longer has a lead,
      then the community group chair(s) take over that role
      until a new project lead can be identified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Project leads <em>may</em> maintain lists
      of project team members or contributors
      who may participate in the project decision process,
      so long as the process of identifying team members
      is documented, fair, and consistent with
      the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/#cgroups">Community and Business Group Process</a>.
      In the absence of an explicit project team list,
      the project team consists of any community group members
      who choose to participate in the project's discussions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The community group chair(s) will work to
      coordinate communication,
      support project leads,
      resolve disputes within project teams,
      and to liase with the SVG working group,
      other working groups,
      and W3C management.
      The chairs may delegate any of these tasks
      to other group members.

      and <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-svgcg/">mailing list</a>
      <em>should</em> be used primarily for
      administrative matters,
      announcements,
      introductions,
      procedural guidance,
      and other non-technical discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group's IRC channel (<a href="irc://irc.w3.org:6667/#svgcg">#svgcg</a>)
      <em>may</em> be used by group members
      for informal real-time collaboration,
      provided that all technical contributions and decisions
      are recorded in the relevant GitHub commits or issue tracker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other methods of communication
      (for example, social media accounts)
      may be used by the chair(s) or their delegates
      to increase awareness of the community group's activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The community group <em>may</em> hold annual face-to-face meetings
      as part of W3C's TPAC.
      In addition,
      project teams <em>may</em> choose to arrange meetings
      (teleconference, videoconference, or face-to-face)
      as needed,
      so long as they meet the requirements of the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/#cgroups">Community Group Meeting Policies</a>
      regarding advance notice and published minutes.
      An <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/internal-svgcg/">internal mailing list</a>
      is available to coordinate meeting logistics
      (but notice and agendas must be made on a public forum).
    </p>
    <p>
      Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative and should be recorded
      in a GitHub Issue (for technical matters)
      or otherwise on the group's public mail list
      (for administrative and procedural matters not associated with a particular repository).
      Any group participant may object to a decision reached
      at an online or in-person meeting within 7 days of publication of the decision,
      provided that they include clear technical reasons for their objection.
      The Chairs will facilitate discussion to try to resolve the
      objection according to the <a href="#decision">decision process</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="projects-leads"><a class="permalink" href="#projects-leads">§</a>
      Projects and Project Leads</h3>

    <p>
      Any group members may propose a new project.
      The chair(s) will maintain a forum
      for discussing project proposals
      and seeking collaborators.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chair(s) or other group members delegated by the chair(s)
      <em>must</em> create a new project repository
      in response to a request in this forum,
      if the following conditions are met:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The project proposal contains a clear description
        of its intended deliverables,
        including whether any reports would be proposals for normative specifications.
      </li>
      <li>The project description is <a href="#scope">in scope</a> for the community group.
      </li>
      <li>The project proposal contains an initial statement
        of how it may impact the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/process/charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> areas:
        privacy, security, accessibility, internationalization,
        and the technical architecture of the web platform
        (collectively, the <dfn id="dfn-horizontal-impacts">horizontal impacts statement</dfn>).
      </li>
      <li>The people proposing the project
        are community group members who have made the required licensing agreements.
      </li>
      <li>
        None of the people involved in the project
        have a history of contravening the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The initial project leads are the people who made the project request,
      or as otherwise identified in the discussion for the proposal.
      Thereafter, project teams may select new leads
      by consensus or through the <a href="#decision">decision process</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Project leads <em>must</em> ensure that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        All project deliverables meet the requirements
        of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/#cgroups">Community and Business Group Process</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Substantive contributions are only accepted from people
        who have made the relevant <a href="#licensing">licensing agreements</a>.
      </li>
      <li>The project <a href="#dfn-horizontal-impacts">horizontal impacts statement</a>
        is kept up to date as the project progresses,
        and is available in the project repository
        (either as a stand-alone document or as a section in a draft report or project ReadMe file).
      </li>
      <li>Any technical discussions,
        decisions,
        or contributions
        made through non-GitHub communication channels
        (for example, IRC chat, the mailing list, or teleconferences)
        are copied over to GitHub with correct attribution.
      </li>
      <li>All discussion and activity related to the project
        is consistent with
        the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>,
        and any conduct violations are addressed following
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/#Procedures">the specified procedures</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If any community group member objects
        (in writing, using the project's issue tracker)
        to any change to the project deliverables,
        team membership,
        or process,
        a formal decision from the project team
        is sought using the <a href="#decision">decision process</a>.
      </li>
      <li>If implementations of a proposed feature
        mean that all or part of a project will no longer be in
        in <a href="#out-of-scope">scope for the community group</a>,
        the chair(s) are informed
        and an <a href="https://wicg.github.io/admin/intent-to-migrate.html">intent to migrate</a> request is prepared.
      </li>
      <li>If they cannot fulfil the responsibilities of project lead,
        they inform the chair(s) and start a process of selecting a new lead.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The chair(s) may appoint new project leads at any time
      if the current project leads fail to fulfill these obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any project may become inactive
      if the project team or leads decide that it has completed its work,
      or that further work is no longer desired.
      The project lead(s) or chair(s) <em>must</em> ensure that
      Inactive projects are clearly identified as such
      in the project repository,
      and <em>must not</em> accept new contributions
      other than errata.
    </p>
    <p>
      Project leads <em>may</em> request at any time
      to publish a document for the project as a draft report of the community group.
      If the document meets the requirements
      for <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/#cgroups">Community Group Deliverables</a>,
      the chair(s) must request a community-group decision
      on whether to adopt the draft.
    </p>
    <p>
      When project leads believe that
      a specification proposal project has completed incubation,
      they <em>should</em> prepare
      an <a href="https://wicg.github.io/admin/intent-to-migrate.html">intent to migrate</a> request
      (published within the project repository).
      After receiving notification of the request,
      the chair(s) <em>must</em> request a community-group decision
      on whether to adopt the proposal as a final report.
      In addition, the chair(s) <em>should</em> work with the project leads
      to transition the proposed specification
      to the SVG working group or other standards group.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chair(s) <em>should</em> ensure that new projects,
      project reports,
      and changes to project status (completed or inactive)
      are announced to the all community group members.
    </p>

    <h2 id="transparency"><a class="permalink" href="#transparency">§</a>
      Transparency
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group will conduct all of its technical work in public.
      All technical work will occur in, or be recorded in,
      its GitHub repositories.
      This is to ensure contributions
      can be tracked through a software tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meetings may be restricted to Community Group participants, but a public
      summary or minutes must be posted to the group's public mailing list
      (for administrative discussion),
      or to a GitHub issue (for technical discussion).
    </p>

    <h2 id="decision"><a class="permalink" href="#decision">§</a>
      Decision Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      This group — as a whole and for individual projects —
      will seek to make decisions where there is consensus.
      The following process is to be used to make decisions
      in any of these situations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consensus cannot be reached after a reasonable amount of discussion.</li>
      <li>Any group member formally objects to a decision or action.</li>
      <li>Another section of this charter requires a formal decision of the group.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A decision process <em>should</em> be managed either by a project lead
      (for a project technical decision),
      or by a chair
      (for any decision).
    </p>
    <p>
      The decision process,
      and any formal objections or other requests for a decision,
      <em>must</em> be carried out in writing in the following locations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>For technical matters related to a project, 
        in the relevant project's GitHub issue tracker.
      </li>
      <li>For administrative or process matters
          in the community group's mailing list
          or in administrative forums or repositories set up for this purpose.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For a project technical decision,
      the decision process participants are project team members.
      For an administrative or procedural decision,
      including any debate on who should qualify as a project team member,
      the decision process participants are any community group member
      as of the time the decision process is initiated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chair or project lead managing the decision process
      <em>should</em> start by publishing a proposed resolution
      with a Call for Consensus (CfC).
      Alternatively, if there is no clear proposed resolution,
      the chair or project lead <em>may</em> issue a Call for Proposals (CfP),
      asking for suggested courses of action to resolve the issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Call for Consensus or Call for Proposals
      <em>must</em> include an explicit end date,
      at least 7 days from publication of the call.
      During that period,
      decision process participants
      may respond with an objection (to a CfC)
      and an alternative proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      If no objections to a proposed resolution are received by the end date of the CfC,
      or if only one proposed resolution is received for a CfP,
      then that proposal is accepted as a decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, however, the CfC/CfP period ends with more than one proposed action,
      the chair or project lead managing the decision process
      <em>must</em> call for a vote.
      A vote may use an online poll/form,
      or may be conducted by written replies,
      so long as vote participants are identifiable.
      The call for a vote <em>must</em> include a new end date
      (at least another 7 days in the future).
      Decision process participants <em>should</em>
      then respond to indicate their preferred course of action
      (possibly ranked, if there are many alternatives).
      At the end of the voting period,
      the chair or project lead managing the decision process
      <em>must</em> select an alternative with substantial support
      and publish it in the same forum as the original call for a decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any group members still disagree with a decision about a project,
      they <em>may</em> request to start a new project
      that is a fork of the original one.
      This is explicitly allowed (and
      preferred to blocking progress) with a goal of letting implementation
      experience inform which spec is ultimately chosen by the group to move
      ahead with.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process is
      fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favour
      or discriminate against any group participant or their employer.
    </p>

    <h2 id="chairs"><a class="permalink" href="#chairs">§</a>
      Chair Selection
    </h2>
    <p>
      Participants in this group choose their Chair(s) and can replace their
      Chair(s) by consensus or by following the <a href="#decision">decision process</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if 5
      participants, no two from the same organisation, call for an election,
      the group must use the following process to replace any current Chair(s)
      with a new Chair, consulting the Community Development Lead on election
      operations (e.g., voting infrastructure and using <a href=
      "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2777">RFC 2777</a>).
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have 14 days to
      announce their candidacies, but this period ends as soon as all
      participants have announced their intentions. If there is only one
      candidate, that person becomes the Chair. If there are two or more
      candidates, there is a vote. Otherwise, nothing changes.
      </li>
      <li>Participants vote. Participants have 21 days to vote for a single
      candidate, but this period ends as soon as all participants have voted.
      The individual who receives the most votes, no two from the same
      organisation, is elected chair. In case of a tie, RFC2777 is used to
      break the tie. An elected Chair may appoint co-Chairs.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the
      Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development Lead,
      after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.
    </p>
    <h2 id="charter-change"><a class="permalink" href="#charter-change">§</a>
      Amendments to this Charter
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group can decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing the
      text using the <a href="#decision">Decision Process</a> described above.
      The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made by
      conducting a 30-day vote on the proposed new charter. The new charter, if
      approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself,
      or 7 days after the result of the election is announced, whichever is
      later. A new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast in the approval
      vote to pass. The group may make simple corrections to the charter such
      as deliverable dates by the simpler group decision process rather than
      this charter amendment process. The group will use the amendment process
      for any substantive changes to the goals, scope, deliverables, decision
      process or rules for amending the charter.
