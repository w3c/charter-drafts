      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>

        <p>The goal of this charter period is to complete the SVG 2 specification as a W3C Recommendation. To accomplish this goal, the group will create a test suite, generate an implementation report which confirms multiple interoperable implementations of each feature of the specification, and remove all features from the stable specification which do not have adequate implementation. Features removed from the specification, and new proposed features, may be published as Working Group Notes or incubated further in a Community Group or other appropriate venue.</p>
  
        <p>The SVG WG develops the core SVG language and related modules, consisting of:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Markup syntaxes</strong>, compatible with XML and HTML5 parsing, for describing shapes, text, and painting effects, including gradients, filters, and other graphical effects, through a set of elements and attributes.  This includes semantics for navigation and interactivity.</li>

          <li>An <strong>API</strong>, compatible with DOM (Document Object Model), for using script to view, add, remove, or change the elements and attributes of the DOM tree, to handle interactivity and animation, and to provide special functionality, through a set of events and methods.</li>

          <li>A set of <strong>styling characteristics</strong>, expressible as presentation attributes or CSS properties, for defining the appearance and behavior of graphical elements.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Scalable Vector Graphics has matured into a widely-implemented specification for interactive graphics, used in viewers, authoring tools, and in other standards.  The SVG Working Group builds upon this solid foundation by adding new graphical and behavioral features to make it even easier for content creators to make compelling and effective graphical content, interactive data visualization, and web applications.</p>

        <p>The SVG WG collaborates with the <a href="#css-wg">CSS WG</a> for shared features, and with the <a href="#aria-wg">ARIA WG</a> in the SVG Accessibility Task Force for making graphics and data visualizations accessible to users of Accessibility Technology. Joint deliverables with these groups are denoted in the <a href="#deliverables">Deliverables</a> section.</p>
        
        <p>The 2016 charter revision removes several specifications from the scope of the SVG WG, and does not add any deliverables to the scope, though it does note the expansion of the SVG accessibility API mappings deliverable to three separate documents for organizational purposes. For details, see the <a href="#charter-2016">list of charter differences</a>. In addition, discussion and coordination for a future Level of Detail specification will continue.</p>

        <p>This group develops specifications which are backwards-compatible and which reflect the current state of interoperability between existing implementations, for ease of SVG authoring. Some new functionality may be defined in module specifications to promote quick review and implementation.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
          <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsCR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have at least two independent implementations of each of feature defined in the specification.</p>
          <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing any known security or privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
          <p>Each specification should contain a section describing known impacts on accessibility to users with disabilities, ways the specification features address them, and recommendations for minimizing accessibility problems in implementation.</p>

        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 5 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="">SVG Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most SVG Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a id="www-svg" href="mailto:www-svg@w3.org">www-svg@w3.org</a> (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-svg/">archive</a>)
          and on <a id="github-issues" href="https://github.com/w3c/svgwg/issues">GitHub issues</a>. 
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/policies#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          All resolutions will be in announced in the meeting minutes or an email or survey call for consensus (CfC), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.

          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
