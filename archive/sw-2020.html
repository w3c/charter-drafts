        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>Web Applications traditionally assume that the network is reachable, which is not always the case. The Working Group will specify event-driven services between the network layer and the application, allowing it to handle network requests gracefully even while offline.</p>

        <p><i>Draft state</i> indicates the state of the deliverable at the time of
          the charter approval. The Working Group intends to publish the latest
          state of their work as Candidate Recommendation and does not
          intend to advance their documents to Recommendation (no expected

            Other Deliverables
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Service Workers Working Group will determine the next steps for the following WICG specification, and may by group decision adopt it as a deliverable:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt id="background-fetch" class="spec">Background
              Fetch</dt>
              <dd><p>An API to handle large uploads/downloads in

          specification</a> from <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">WICG</a></p>
            </dd>
  </dl>
      <p>Next steps for Background Fetch may include promotion to Working Group deliverable (with agreed changes), or deprecation.</p>
	  <p>The following specifications are in scope for <em>discussion and incubation</em> within the Working Group, but formal publication on the Recommendation track would require re-charter to get consensus and commitments:</p>

<dl>
          <dt id="background-sync" class="spec">Web Background
            Synchronisation</dt>
            <dd> <p>This specification defines an API that uses Service Workers to permit both one-off and periodic synchronisation of data,
              for applications that use non-local data storage.</p>
            <p class="draft-status"><b>Draft state:</b> <a href="https://wicg.github.io/BackgroundSync/spec/">Adopted

            </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Next steps for those documents may include promotion to Working Group deliverables (via a new charter), or deprecation.</p>
	<p>
          If additional in-<a href="#scope">scope</a> Recommendation-track deliverables are wanted before the Charter expires, the Working Group will prepare an updated Charter that differs only in deliverables.
        </p>
          <p>
            Other non-normative documents may be created such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use case and requirement documents;</li>
            <li>Test suite and implementation report for the specification;</li>
            <li>Primer or Best Practice documents to support web developers when designing applications.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

      </section>

	<section id="success-criteria">
	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
	  <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
    <p>To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.</p>
    <p>All new features should be supported by at least two intents to implement before being incorporated in the specification.</p>
    <p>If a critical mass of key stakeholders and implementers of this technology do not join the group, its charter should be re-examined by the W3C.</p>
	</section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>
      </section>



      <section id="communication">
        <h2>
          Communication
        </h2>
        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/sw/">Service Workers Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Service Workers Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work
           on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.
        </p>
      </section>



      <section id="decisions">
        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period of <span id='cfc'>one week</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
