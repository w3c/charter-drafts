	<p>Web Applications traditionally assume that the network is reachable, which is not always the case.
          The Working Group will specify event-driven services between the network layer and the application,
          allowing it to handle network requests gracefully even while offline.

            for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
          <p>Each specification should have an associated testing plan developed in parallel,
            and complete by the time the specification reaches 
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR">Candidate Recommendation</a>; by Recommendation, there should be test suite for each deliverable, sufficiently broad to demonstrate interoperability.</p>
<p>Each specification should have implementation reports showing adoption, fostering the ready availability of multiple, independent, interoperable implementations, including in browsers, authoring, and validation tools, and usage on the Web.</p>

          <p>If a critical mass of key stakeholders and implementers of this technology do not join the group, its charter should be re-examined by the W3C.</p>

	<p>The Working group may produce multiple versions of each deliverable, reflecting developments
          in how much of the relevant technology is interoperably
              implemented.
	</p>
        <p>
          The working group intends to use a parallel specification-editing and -testing approach,
          where all normative specification changes are generally expected to have a corresponding test change, either
          in the form of new tests or modifications to existing tests, or must include the rationale for
          why test updates are not required for the proposed update.
        </p>

        <p>
	The participants of the current Working Group are looking forward to
	moving this work to an "Evergreen standard" model as is being
	discussed for Process 2020.

          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.

        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about

          Most Service Worker Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.

        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.

Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
