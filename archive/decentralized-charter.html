    <section id="scope" class="scope">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>The web is the primary method of accessing information and services for over 4,000,000,000 people. The
        decentralized nature of the web has given individuals and organizations a platform to communicate and operate
        businesses around the world.</p>
      <p>For a decentralized system to properly function, each system component must interact and function in a
        consistent, reliable, and stable fashion. Standards enable these decentralized components to interact and
        function as if they were an integrated, centralized system. Without the proper assessment, changes to web
        standards can thus have significant impacts on people, industries and societies that are challenging for any one
        individual or group to foresee.</p>
      <p>Where changes to web standards impact stakeholder groups that are underrepresented within the W3C these
        unintended consequences are often missed or discovered late in the process.</p>
      <p>To address this challenge, DWIG develops guidelines to assist specification authors in identifying, balancing
        and mitigating unintended consequences early in the specification development process. This input enables
        proposal authors to address those concerns that might otherwise be raised later as issues or objections, thus
        reducing the overall time from proposal to consensus.</p>
      <p>DWIG may provide input on request to other W3C groups developing web standards to help identify early impacts
        on the broader web community beyond the focus of their specification.</p>
      <p>DWIG provides short commentary on matters presented to the AC for consideration where there is a risk the
        matter will impact on the stability or decentralized nature of the web.</p>
      <p>DWIG aims to include members with diverse skillsets and backgrounds to ensure its work benefits from
        disciplines such as business, economics, law, policy and product, whose broad experience are often
        underrepresented in other specific interest, incubation and working groups.</p>
      <p>The web must be a stable and sustainable place for all to operate if the W3C are to continue to advance its
        mission.</p>
      <section id="section-out-of-scope">
        <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
        <p>The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this Interest group.</p>
        <ul class="out-of-scope">
          <li>DWIG does not incubate standards or specifications work to avoid overlap with other incubation, interest
            and working groups.</li>
          <li>DWIG does not define policy decisions related to what are “good” or “bad” changes, but instead provides
            guidance to proposal authors and reviewers to ensure they consider potential impacts to stability and
            decentralized nature of the web beyond the scope of their group.</li>

      <h2>
        Deliverables
      </h2>
      <p>DWIG maintains a Self-Review Questionnaire for concerns of Decentralization, Choice, Auditability, and
        Accountability that contribute to the decentralized, stable One Web.</p>
      <p>DWIG will maintain an introductory document to help proposal authors better understand foreseeable impacts of
        their work by summarising and linking to external documents and bodies of work related to relevant topics.</p>
      <p>DWIG may publish other documents consistent with the above scope.</p>
      <p>Note: drafts of <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-advertising/blob/master/success-criteria.md">success
          criteria</a> and the <a
          href="https://github.com/w3c/web-advertising/blob/master/interoperability-choice-accessibility-accountability-questionairre.md">questionnaire</a>

    <section id="success-criteria">
      <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduce the time associated with the specification development process by helping proposal authors consider a
          wider range of issues during the inception of their specifications.</li>
        <li>Foreseeable impacts associated with Web standards are mitigated and avoided early in the specification
          development process.</li>
        <li>Wider adoption of changes in a manner that supports the decentralized, stable One Web.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="coordination">
      <h2>Coordination</h2>
      <p>For all specifications, this Interest Group will seek <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/process/charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for
        accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest
        Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
        Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a> and at least
        3 months before <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a>,
        and should be issued when major changes occur in a specification.</p>
      <p class="issue"><b>Issue:</b> The paragraph above replaces line-item liaisons and dependencies with individual
        horizontal groups. There's been a suggestion to name and individually link the specific horizontal groups
        inline, instead of pointing to a page that lists them.</p>
      <p class="issue"><b>Issue:</b> The requirement for an invitation to review after FPWD and before CR may seem a bit
        overly restrictive, but it only requires an invitation, not a review, a commitment to review, or even a response
        from the horizontal group. This compromise offers early notification without introducing a bottleneck.</p>
      <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>
      <p class="todo">In addition to the above catch-all reference to horizontal review which includes accessibility
        review, please check with chairs and staff contacts of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible
          Platform Architectures Working Group</a> to determine if an additional liaison statement with more specific
        information about concrete review issues is needed in the list below.</p>

      <p>Participation in DWIG is open to the public. Participants who do not represent a W3C Member should join as
        Invited Experts. <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/08/invexp.html">Invited Experts</a> in this group are not
        granted access to Member-only information.</p>
      <p>Anyone may subscribe to the group's public mailing list and engage in discussion. Those who intend to
        contribute to deliverables will be asked to join the group. </p>
      <p>The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as
        described in Communication.</p>
      <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the W3C <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

        Communication

      <p id="public">
        Technical discussions for this Interest Group are conducted in <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from
        teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue
        tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working
        Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct
        public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
      </p>
      <p>
        Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and
        meetings) will be available from the Decentralized Web Interest Group home page.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Most Decentralized Web Interest Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and
        will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        This group primarily conducts its technical work on <a id="public-github" href="[link to Github repo]">GitHub
          issues</a>.
        The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the
        Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a
        discussion.
      </p>

    <section id="decisions">
      <h2>
        Decision Policy
      </h2>
      <p>
        This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an
        editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the
        group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
      <p>
        However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful
        consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along
        with any objections.
      </p>
      <p>
        To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication
        decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

        A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey),
        with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group
        consensus on the issue.

        If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be
        considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Interest Group.
      </p>
      <p>
        All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available
        or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
      </p>
      <p>
        This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C
          Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document
        requires.

    <section id="patentpolicy">
      <h2>Patent Disclosures </h2>
      <p>The Interest Group provides an opportunity to
        share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
        Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
        disclosure obligations as set out in <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
          6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
        produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
        participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
        Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply. For more information about disclosure obligations for this
        group,
