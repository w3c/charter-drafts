        <h2>Scope</h2>
	<p>This Working Group will define APIs for user agents ("UA"s hereafter) embedded in digital signage terminal devices ("devices" hereafter).</p>

	<p>Web-based signage is a digital signage using web technologies. Web-based signage terminal functions are performed by a web application loaded on a UA. The web application is called a Web-based Signage Player (“player” hereafter), which shows digital signage contents in accordance with the order provided by the digital signage server. The player also should have terminal management functions such as terminal configuration, logging, and reporting as well as content management. Usually, once a player is loaded on a UA, it works automatically.</p>
	
	<p>Two types of users exist for UAs of the devices. They are a device operator who remotely operates devices and audiences who watch the devices. The device operator, not always a human being but a server function, has access to UAs of devices. The operator typically does not have access to the devices physically but wants to control the devices beyond the network. On the contrary, audiences, who are anonymous and in the general public, do not have control over devices.</p>

	<p>The signage UA should provide API for the player to be used by a device operator.</p>

	<p>The Working Group will define the prior required APIs for the operator to manage the signage UA via web console of the controlling device. Basically, the APIs are classified to the following functions:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Get the device information</li>
	    <li>Control the device</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>

	<p>These operations require protection mechanism to prevent unauthorized accesses.</p>

	<p>The specifications produced by this Working Group will address security and privacy considerations because the device UAs controlled by the device operator rather than the audiences watching the devices. The considerations need to address the combination of both the UAs and the controlling device.</p>

	<p>Members of the Working Group should review other working groups' deliverables that identified as being relevant to the Working Group's mission.</p>

        <div id="section-out-of-scope">
          <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
            <p>The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this Working Group.</p>

            <ul class="out-of-scope">
	      <li>This Working Group will not define or mandate hardware specification of devices.</li>
	      <li>This Working Group will not define the APIs for generic UAs but them for embedded UAs in devices.</li>
	      <li>This Working Group will not also define the security configuration because it depends on the device hardware configuration.</li>
            </ul>

          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
          <p>In order to advance to  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsCR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have at least two independent implementations of each of feature defined in the specification.</p>
          <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing any known security or privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

            Normative Specifications
          </h3>
          <p>
            The working group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications:
          </p>
	    <dl>
	      <dt id="web-rmapi-power-management" class="spec">Power Status Management</dt>
	      <dd>
		  <p>This function consists of Power Status Control and Power Status Scheduling. This enables web applications to access the device’s power management system. Consulting the power status mode of the device, there are stand-by mode (display off and UA stopped) and display-off mode (only display off) in addition to running mode (display on and UA running). Power Status Control provides the function of changing the power status mode of the device to such modes for saving power.  Resuming from stand-by mode, it needs a scheduled return, which is provided by Power Status Scheduling. By studying the use cases, the function will be consulted for enhancement.</p>
		  <p class="draft-status"><b>Draft state:</b>[No draft]</p>
	      </dd>
		  <dt id="web-rmapi-other-contextual" class="spec">Contextual Information</dt>
	      <dd>
		  <p>The function consists of Signage Operational Information and Signage Functional Information. The information provided by this function is used for the device management and the content management for signage services. Signage Operational Information provides the unique information of the device such as hardware information (serial number, manufacture name, or model name), which is used for the device identification. Signage Functional Information allows us to get the functional information of the device such as resolution and size of display used for fitting the contents to display. The information obtained for the remote management may be enriched by use case discussion.</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 10 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementers of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration, with the agreement from each participant to Royalty-Free licensing of those submissions under the W3C Patent Policy.

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>. Meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="">Web-based Signage Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Web-based Signage Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a class="todo" id="public-name" href="mailto:public-[email-list]@w3.org">public-<i class="todo">[email-list]</i>@w3.org</a> (<a class="todo" href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-[email-list]/">archive</a>). The public is invited to post messages to this list.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/policies#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
