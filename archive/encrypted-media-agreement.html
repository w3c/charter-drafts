    <h1>Encrypted Media Agreement</h1>

    <p>
      The Web has been built through iteration and collaboration, and enjoys strong security because so many people are able to continually test and review its designs and implementations. As the Web gains interfaces to new device capabilities, we rely even more on broad participation, testing, and audit to keep users safe and the web’s security model intact. Therefore, W3C policy should assure that such broad testing and audit continues to be possible, as it is necessary to keep both design and implementation quality high.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following obligations shall apply to all participants in the <a href='https://www.w3.org/html/wg/'>W3C HTML Media Extension Working Group</a>. These obligations will be referenced from each Working Group charter and Calls for Participation.
    </p>
    <h2>1. Security Research Requirements for All Working Group Participants</h2>
    <p>
      As a condition of participating in a Working Group, each participant (W3C Members, W3C Team members, invited experts, and members of the public)
      shall agree to make available under <a href='#medialicense'>W3C Encrypted Extensions licensing requirements</a> any implementations related to the work of that particular Working Group. This requirement includes Implementations that the participant owns and any that the participant has the right to license.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the affirmative act of joining a Working Group, or otherwise agreeing to the licensing terms described here, will obligate a Member to the W3C Encrypted Extensions licensing commitments. Mere Membership in W3C alone, without other factors, does not give rise to the Content Protection licensing obligation under this policy.
    </p>
    <h2 id='medialicense'>2. W3C Encrypted Extensions Licensing Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      With respect to a Recommendation developed under this policy, a W3C Encrypted Extensions license shall mean a non-assignable, non-sublicensable license that:
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>
      exempt computer programs, operating solely for the purpose of good-faith security research related to implementations of the Recommendation. “good-faith security research” means accessing a computer program solely for purposes of good-faith testing, investigation and/or correction of a security flaw or vulnerability, where the information derived from the activity is used primarily to promote the security or safety of the implementation of the Recommendation on which the computer program operates, and is not used or maintained in a manner that facilitates copyright infringement.
    </li>
    <li>
      may not impose any further conditions or restrictions on the circumvention of a technological measure for the sole purpose of identifying and analyzing those elements of the program that are necessary to achieve interoperability of an independently created implementation of the Recommendation, and that have not previously been readily available to the person engaging in the circumvention. The information acquired through the acts may be made available to others if the person provides such information or means solely for the purpose of enabling interoperability of an independently created implementation of the Recommendation.
    </li>
    </ol>
