        <h2>Background</h2>
        <!-- <p><i class="todo">Brief background of landscape, technology, and relationship to the Web, users, developers, implementers, and industry.</i></p> -->
        <p>
          The Portable Network Graphics (PNG) raster image format
          was <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pnghist.html">first developed</a> in 1994
           by an informal group outside W3C,
           as an improvement to
           the existing GIF and TIFF raster image formats.
           Following widespread adoption,
           it was published in October 1996 as a
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-png-961001">W3C Recommendation</a>
          and in March 1997 as
          <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2083">Informational RFC 2083</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A second edition,
          incorporating all known errata and substantial clarifications,
          was jointly published by W3C, as
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-PNG-20031110">Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Specification (Second Edition)</a>,
          and by ISO, as
          <i>Information technology — Computer graphics and image processing — Portable Network Graphics (PNG): Functional specification. ISO/IEC 15948:2003 (E)</i>.
          This specification is widely implemented;
          most implementations rely on a standard library,
          <a href="https://libpng.sourceforge.io/index.html">libpng</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since that time, <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/11/REC-PNG-20031110-errata">errata</a> have accumulated
          which require incorporation into a new edition.
          These are <a href="https://github.com/w3c/PNG-spec/issues">tracked
          on GitHub</a> and
          an <a href="https://w3c.github.io/PNG-spec/">Editors Draft</a>
          is being maintained which incorporates these errata
          and updates referenced specifications
          to the latest versions.
          Correct resolution of some errata require further discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, some new features have been proposed.
          Notably, an
          <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/APNG_Specification">animation extension (APNG)</a>
          is now <em>widely deployed</em> but,
          because it is not part of the official standard,
          is typically implemented as a patch or extension to libpng
          (for example, <a href="https://github.com/onevcat/APNGKit">APNGKit</a>).
          There is thus a need for a standardized specification which incorporates this already-deployed extension.
          This will allow it to be supported directly in libpng.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, a means for
          <a href="https://github.com/w3c/ColorWeb-CG/blob/master/hdr-in-png-requirements.md">Adding support for HDR imagery to the PNG format</a> has been incubated in the W3C
          <a href="https://github.com/w3c/ColorWeb-CG">Color on the Web Community Group</a>. This re-uses the existing ITU H.273
          controlled vocabulary for the parameterization of color space information.
        </p>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>

        <p>Maintain the PNG specification, folding in solutions to reported errata.</p>

        <p>Add selected new features which will be broadly useful,
          are demanded by users,
          and have significant implementer interest.
        </p>

        <p>
          When developing any new features,
          the stability and interoperability with existing image files
          and image creation and consuming software
          will be a primary consideration.
        </p>

	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
	  <p>
      In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification.</p>
	  <p>Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
	  <p>
		Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
		recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>
	  <p>
      To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.</p>
	</section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

      	<!-- <p class="todo">In addition to the above catch-all reference to horizontal review which includes accessibility review, please check with chairs and staff contacts of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group</a> to determine if an additional liaison statement with more specific information about concrete review issues is needed in the list below.</p>

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <!--a href="https://www.w3.org/Graphics/PNG/WG"-->PNG Working Group home page.<!--/a-->
        </p>
        <p>
          Most PNG Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work
           on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/PNG-spec">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period of <span id='cfc'>one week</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
