          Scope
        </h2>
        <p>
          The scope of the WebApps Working Group is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Haptic input devices and their emitted events and/or data.
          </li>
          <li>Textual input and text manipulation.
          </li>
          <li>Data sharing across remote and local web applications.
          </li>
          <li>Receiving and acting upon data from remote sources.
          </li>
          <li>Accessing the file system and persistent storage.
          </li>
          <li>Interfacing with OS capabilities.
          </li>
          <li>Integrating web applications with the OS.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For <a href="#background">historical reasons</a>, the working group
          maintains a specification for mapping HTML elements and attributes to
          platform accessibility APIs, and a separate specification that
          defines author conformance requirements for setting ARIA attributes.
          However, the Working Group does not expect to add any other
          specifications relating to this matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifications produced by the WebApps Working Group enable
          developers to create web applications that work across a wide range
          of platforms and devices, and for a broad diversity of users, by
          addressing matters of accessibility, device independence,
          internationalization, privacy, and security.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>
            Success Criteria
          </h3>
          <p>
            Each specification must have an accompanying test suite, which is
            ideally developed in parallel to the specification. The test suite
            will be used to produce an implementation report before the
            specification transitions to <a href=
            "https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#rec-pr">Proposed
            Recommendation</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each specification must have at least two independent,
            interoperable implementations in wide use (per the <a href=
            "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">W3C
            Process</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            Where there are implications for implementors, developers, or
            users, with regard to accessibility, internationalization, privacy,
            and security, each specification must have a section that describes
            relevant benefits, limitations, and best practice solutions.

          To be successful, the WebApps Working Group is expected to have 10 or
          more active participants for its duration, including representatives
          from at least three key implementors. It is also expected to have
          active Editors and Test Leads for each specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to
          contribute half of a working day per week towards the WebApps Working
          Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public

        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes technical contributions from non-Members, to

          the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings

          issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read

          Drafts of specifications will be developed on public repositories,
          and may permit direct public contribution requests.

        <p>
          Meetings are not open to public participation, however non-members

          Information about the WebApps Working Group (including details about
          deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings)

          This group primarily conducts its technical work on Github. The
          public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for
          administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and
          members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases
          when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due
          process, per the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process
          Document (section 3.3)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant
          makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with
          members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with
          little formal voting being required.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus
          is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views
          presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision
          along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
          resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face
          meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.
        </p>
        <p>
          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for
          example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period
          from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation
          of the group consensus on the issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the
          response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus
          as a resolution of the WebApps Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless
          and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the
          discretion of the Chairs or the Director.

          History of this WG
        </h2>
        <p>
          The WebApps Working Group was a predecessor to the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/">Web Platform Working Group</a>
          (which remains active to work on specifications that are pertinent to
          the discussions relating to a collaboration agreement between the W3C
          and the WHATWG). The remaining specifications have been transferred
          from the Web Platform Working Group to the WebApps Working Group, so
          that progress can continue to be made on those specifications while
          the W3C and WHATWG negotiations are ongoing.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, specifications that have been successfully incubated in
          the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web Platform
          Incubator Community Group (WICG)</a> have been transferred to the
          WebApps Working Group.
