      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>

        <p>The scope of this Working Group is to define an API layer that is agnostic of any underlying audio/video sourcing technologies to enable a web-based application to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>provide Electronic Program Guide (EPG) information associated with the available audio/video sources, including the list of programs and any related information, examples of these are channel number, producers, directors, actors, synopsis, rating, as well as captioning, secondary audio channel, etc;</li>
          <li>control and switch an audio/video source to a specific channel identifier based on EPG data;</li>
          <li>present the selected channels' audio and video streams;</li>
          <li>enable time-shifting scenarios;</li>
          <li>enable parental control based on EPG data;</li>
          <li>schedule recordings on an audio/video source, and maintain these recordings afterwards;</li>
          <li>interact with the audio/video source for presenting other supplemental content appropriately such as emergency alerts;</li>
          <li>scan channels available on an audio/video source;</li>
          <li>access Common Interface (CI) cards, when available.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The API layer will meet the usual requirements of the Web runtime, including privacy and security requirements. Specifically, the user must always be in control of privacy-sensitive information that may be conveyed through the APIs, such as the rendering of tuner output, or channel configurations. In addition, the user must be able to browse Web content, including any tuner functionality related to TV/radio services provided by third parties, in a secure way. The user must also be able to gain information from the API and control actions via the API if they use assistive technologies or custom user agent settings.</p>

        <p>The API layer will be defined with appropriate abstraction model, and will address its relationship with broadcast protocols. TV tuners and radio tuners are in scope. Additional specification for purely IP-based audio/video sources and other audio/video sources (such as HDMI) will be considered based on the capabilities of those sources.</p>

        <p>The Working Group expects to refine the technical solution based on discussions as it makes progress on its deliverables, including answering questions such as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>how to define the mapping between the API layer and the underlying broadcast protocol;</li>
          <li>how to source in-band media resource tracks;</li>
          <li>how to control the entire TV UI, e.g. whether to use a containing web page where the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element resides or to use the current TV model where any web page for interactive is overlaid on top of the TV stream.</li>
        </ul>
 
        <div id="section-out-of-scope">
          <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
            <p>The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this working group:</p>
            
            <ul class="out-of-scope">
              <li>the underlying video sourcing method and technologies;</li>
              <li>the presentation technology and/or presentation application of TV program and supplemental content;</li>
              <li>profiling of the specification to particular device limitations (such as number of simultaneous streams viewable)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
          <p>In order to advance to  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsCR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have at least two independent implementations of each of feature defined in the specification.</p>

          <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing any known security or privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration, with the agreement from each participant to Royalty-Free licensing of those submissions under the W3C Patent Policy.

        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>. Meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="">TV Control Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>        
        <p>
          Most TV Control Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-name@w3.org">public-<i class="todo">[name]</i>@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-name/">archive</a>). The public is invited to post messages to this list.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/policies#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.

          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
